[[British Standards]]

CATEGORIES: 1901 establishments in the United Kingdom, British Standards, International Electrotechnical Commission, Standards organizations, Certification marks, Organisations based in the United Kingdom

British Standards are the standards produced by BSI Group which is incorporated under a Royal Charter (and which is formally designated as the National Standards Body (NSB) for the UK). The BSI Group produces British Standards under the authority of the Charter, which lays down as one of the BSI's objectives to:
Formally, as per the 2002 Memorandum of Understanding between the BSI and the United Kingdom Government, British Standards are defined as:

Products and services which BSI certifies as having met the requirements of specific standards within designated schemes are awarded the Kitemark.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kitemark.com/about-kitemark/ |title=Kitemark.com |publisher=Kitemark.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-03[/tpl]

==How British Standards are made==

The BSI Group as a whole does not produce British Standards, as standards work within the BSI is decentralized.  The governing Board of BSI establishes a Standards Board.  The Standards Board does little apart from setting up Sector Boards (a Sector in BSI parlance being a field of standardization such as ICT, Quality, Agriculture, Manufacturing, or Fire).  Each Sector Board in turn constitutes several Technical Committees.  It is the Technical Committees that, formally, approve a British Standard, which is then presented to the Secretary of the supervisory Sector Board for endorsement of the fact that the Technical Committee has indeed completed a task for which it was constituted.

==The standards==

The standards produced are titled British Standard XXXX-P:YYYY where XXXX is the number of the standard, P is the number of the part of the standard (where the standard is split into multiple parts) and YYYY is the year in which the standard came into effect.  BSI Group currently has over 27,000 active standards. Products are commonly specified as meeting a particular British Standard, and in general this can be done without any certification or independent testing. The standard simply provides a shorthand way of claiming that certain specifications are met, while encouraging manufacturers to adhere to a common method for such a specification.
The Kitemark can be used to indicate certification by BSI, but only where a Kitemark scheme has been set up around a particular standard. It is mainly applicable to safety and quality management standards. There is a common misunderstanding that Kitemarks are necessary to prove compliance with any BS standard, but in general it is neither desirable nor possible that every standard be 'policed' in this way.
Following the move on harmonisation of the standard in Europe, some British Standards are gradually superseded or replaced by the relevant European Standards (EN).

==Status of standards==

Standards are continuously reviewed and developed and are periodically allocated one or more of the following status keywords.Guide to using the BSI shop (retrieved 26-Jan-2013)

==History==

BSI Group began in 1901 as the Engineering Standards Committee, led by James Mansergh, to standardise the number and type of steel sections, in order to make British manufacturers more efficient and competitive.
Over time the standards developed to cover many aspects of tangible engineering, and then engineering methodologies including quality systems, safety and security.

==Examples of British Standards==

==PAS Documents==

BSI also publishes a series of PAS documents. 
PAS documents are a flexible and rapid standards development model that is open to all organizations. A PAS is a sponsored piece of work allowing organizations flexibility in the rapid creation of a standard while also allowing for a greater degree of control over the document's development. A typical development time frame for a PAS is around 6–9 months. Once published by BSI a PAS has all the functionality of a British Standard for the purposes of creating schemes such as management systems and product benchmarks as well as codes of practice. A PAS is a living document and after two years the document will be reviewed and a decision made with the client as to whether or not this should be taken forward to become a formal British standard.  The term PAS was originally an acronym derived from "product approval specification", a name which was subsequently changed to “publicly available specification”.  However, according to BSI, not all PAS documents are structured as specifications and the term is now sufficiently well established not to require any further amplification.

[[Building society]]

CATEGORIES: Building societies, Cooperatives, Financial services, Financial institutions, Mutual organizations, Social economy

A building society is a financial institution owned by its members as a mutual organisation. Building societies offer banking and related financial services, especially mortgage lending. These institutions are found in the United Kingdom (UK) and several other countries.
The term "building society" first arose in the 18th century in Great Britain from cooperative savings groups. In the UK today, building societies actively compete with banks for most consumer banking services, especially mortgage lending and savings accounts.
Every building society in the UK is a member of the Building Societies Association. At the start of 2008, there were 59 building societies in the UK, with total assets exceeding £360 billion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bsa.org.uk |title=Building Societies Association |publisher=Bsa.org.uk |date= |accessdate=6 June 2012[/tpl] The number of societies in the UK fell by four during 2008 due to a series of mergers brought about, to a large extent, by the consequences of the financial crisis of 2007-2010. With three further mergers in each of 2009 and 2010, and a demutualisation and a merger in 2011, the current number of building societies is at 45.

==History==

The origins of the building society as an institution lie in late-18th century Birmingham – a town which was undergoing rapid economic and physical expansion driven by a multiplicity of small metalworking firms, whose many highly skilled and prosperous owners readily invested in property.[tpl]Cite book|last=Ashworth|first=Herbert|title=The Building Society Story|year=1980|publisher=Franey & Co.|location=London|isbn=0-900382-38-4|page=4[/tpl]; [tpl]Cite book|last=Berg|first=Maxine|editor=Berg, Maxine|title=Markets and Manufacture in Early Industrial Europe|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NfkNAAAAQAAJ|accessdate=7 September 2010|year=1991|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-03720-4|page=194|chapter=Commerce and Creativity in Eighteenth-Century Birmingham|chapterurl=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NfkNAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA173[/tpl] Many of the early building societies were based in taverns or coffeehouses, which had become the focus for a network of clubs and societies for co-operation and the exchange of ideas among Birmingham's highly active citizenry as part of the movement known as the Midlands Enlightenment.[tpl]Cite book|last=Jones|first=Peter M.|title=Industrial Enlightenment: Science, technology and culture in Birmingham and the West Midlands, 1760–1820|year=2009|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|isbn=0-7190-7770-2|page=65[/tpl]; [tpl]Cite news|first=Carl|last=Chinn|title=Brum's building society origins|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Brum's+building+society+origins-a0188546654857|work=Strabane Mail|publisher=Birmingham Post and Mail Ltd.|date=15 November 2008|accessdate=6 September 1905[/tpl] The first building society to be established was Ketley's Building Society, founded by Richard Ketley, the landlord of the Golden Cross inn, in 1775.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bsa.org.uk/consumer/factsheets/100009.htm|title=The History of Building Societies|accessdate=6 September 2010|last=Rex|first=Simon|date=20 April 2010|publisher=Building Societies Association[/tpl]; [tpl]Cite book|last=Ashworth|first=Herbert|title=The Building Society Story|year=1980|publisher=Franey & Co.|location=London|isbn=0-900382-38-4|page=2[/tpl] Members of Ketley's society paid a monthly subscription to a central pool of funds which was used to finance the building of houses for members, which in turn acted as collateral to attract further funding to the society, enabling further construction.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Peterson|first=Christopher L.|date=October 1991|publisher=|title=Truth, Understanding, and High-Cost Consumer Credit: The Historical Context of the Truth in Lending Act|journal=Florida Law Review|issue=55|pages=839–840|url=|accessdate=6 September 2010[/tpl] By 1781 three more societies had been established in Birmingham, with a fourth in the nearby town of Dudley; and 19 more formed in Birmingham between 1782 and 1795.[tpl]Citation|last=Clark|first=Peter|year=2002|title=British Clubs and Societies 1580–1800: The Origins of an Associational World|publication-place=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=129|isbn=0-19-924843-5|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=h18rP1hrNLQC&pg=PA129|accessdate=20 November 2010[/tpl] The first outside the English Midlands was established in Leeds in 1785.[tpl]Cite book|last=Cleary|first=E.

Most of the original societies were fully terminating, where they would be dissolved when all members had a house: the last of them, First Salisbury, was wound up in March 1980.[tpl]cite web|last=Rex|first=Simon|title=The History of Building Societies|url=http://www.bsa.org.uk/consumer/factsheets/100009.htm|publisher=Building Societies Association|accessdate=8 June 2010[/tpl] In the 1830s and 1840s a new development took place with the Permanent Building Society, where the society continued on a rolling basis, continually taking in new members as earlier ones completed purchases, such as Leek United Building Society. The main legislative framework for the Building Society was the Building Society Act of 1874, with subsequent amending legislation in 1894, 1939 (see Coney Hall), and 1960.
In their heyday, there were hundreds of building societies: just about every town in the country had a building society named after that town. Over succeeding decades the number of societies has decreased, as various societies merged to form larger ones, often renaming in the process, and other societies opted for demutualisation followed by – in the great majority of cases – eventual takeover by a listed bank. Most of the existing larger building societies are the end result of the mergers of many smaller societies.

===1980s and 1990s===

In the 1980s, British banking laws were changed to allow building societies to offer banking services equivalent to normal banks. The management of a number of societies still felt that they were unable to compete with the banks, and a new Building Societies Act was passed in 1986 in response to their concerns. This permitted societies to 'demutualise'. If more than 75% of members voted in favour, the building society would then become a limited company like any other. Members' mutual rights were exchanged for shares in this new company. A number of the larger societies made such proposals to their members and all were accepted. Some became independent companies quoted on the London Stock Exchange, others were acquired by larger financial groups.
The process began with the demutualisation of the Abbey National building society in 1989. Then, from 1995 to late-1999, eight societies demutualised accounting for two-thirds of building societies assets as at 1994. Five of these societies became joint stock banks (Plc), one merged with another and the other four were taken over by Plc's (in two cases after the mutual had previously converted to a Plc).
As Tayler (2003) refers, demutualisation moves succeeded immediately because neither Conservative nor Labour party UK Governments created a framework which put obstacles in the way of demutualisation. Political acquiescence in demutualisation was clearest in the case of the position on 'carpet baggers', that is those who joined societies by lodging minimum amounts of £100 or so in the hope of profiting from a distribution of surplus after demutualisation. The deregulating 1986 Building Societies Act contained an anti-carpet bagger provision in the form of a two-year rule. This prescribed a qualifying period of two years before savers could participate in a residual claim. But, before the 1989 Abbey National Building Society demutualisation, the Courts found against the two-year rule after legal action brought by Abbey National itself to circumvent the intent of the legislators. After this the legislation did prevent a cash distribution to members of less than two years standing, but the same result was obtained by permitting the issue of 'free' shares in the acquiring Plc, saleable for cash. The Thatcher Conservative government declined to introduce amending legislation to make good the defect in the 'two-year rule'.
Building societies, like mutual life insurers, arose as people clubbed together to address a common need interest; in the case of the building societies, this was housing and members were originally both savers and borrowers. But it very quickly became clear that 'outsider' savers were needed whose motive was profit through interest on deposits. Thus permanent building societies quickly became mortgage banks and in such institutions there always existed a conflict of interest between borrowers and savers. It was the task of the movement to reconcile that conflict of interest so as to enable savers to conclude that their interests and those of borrowers were to some extent complementary rather than conflictive. Conflict of interest between savers and borrowers was never fully reconciled in the building societies but upon deregulation that reconciliation became something of a lost cause. The management of building societies apparently could expend considerable time and resources (which belonged the organisation) planning their effective capture—of as much of the assets as they could. If so, this is arguably insider dealing on a grand scale with the benefit of inside specialist knowledge of the business and resources of the firm not shared with outsiders like politicians and members (and, perhaps, regulators). Once the opportunity to claim was presented by management the savers in particular could be relied upon to seize it. There were sufficient hard up borrowers to take the inducement offered them by management (in spite of few simple sums sufficing to demonstrate that they were probably going to end up effectively paying back the inducement). (Tayler 2003)
Managements promoting demutualisation also thereby met managerial objectives because the end of mutuality brought joint stock company (Plc) style remuneration committee pay standards and share options. Share options for management of converting societies appear to be a powerful factor in management calculation. Rasmusen (1988) refers to this in the following terms:
" ... perks do not rise in proportion to mutual bank size. If a mutual is large, or is expected to grow if it can raise capital by a conversion, its managers derive more value from a conversion but do not suffer much loss of perks than if the bank were small. Their benefit is in the right to purchase the new stock, which are valuable because the new issues are consistently underpriced to USA mutual bank conversions. Moreover, by no means are all mutual managers incompetent, and conversions allows the bank to expand more easily and to grant executive stock options that are valuable to skilled managers".
Instead of deploying their margin advantage as a defence of mutuality, around 1980 building societies began setting mortgage rates with reference to market clearing levels. In sum they began behaving more like banks, seeking to maximise profit instead of the advantages of a mutual organisation. Thus, according to the Bank of England's Boxall and Gallagher (1997), "... there was virtually no difference between banks and building society 'listed' interest rates for home finance mortgage lending between 1984 and 1997. This behaviour resulted in a return on assets for building societies which was at least as high as Plc banks and, in the absence of distribution, led to rapid accumulation of reserves". As Boxall and Gallagher (1997) also observe; "... accumulation of reserves in the early-1990's, beyond regulatory and future growth requirements, is difficult to reconcile with conventional theories of mutual behaviour".
Llewellyn (1996) draws a rather more direct and cynical conclusion;
"By adopting a policy of building up reserves by maintaining an excess margin, building societies simultaneously allowed banks to compete and may have undermined the long run viability of mutuality. A more cynical approach is that some societies may have adopted an excess-margin strategy simply to enhance their value for conversion".
Some of these managements ended up in dispute with their own members. Of the first major conversion of the Abbey in 1989, Kay (1991) observed;
" ... the paradox of the Abbey members who campaigned against flotation to a Plc bank of their building society. They were fighting to preserve a degree of accountability to the membership which the management of the Society patently did not feel. For incumbent management, the contrary views of some of their members were not matters to be weighed in the balance and taken account of in formulation of policy. They were a nuisance to be dealt with by the costly use of public relations advisers and legal processes".
In the end, after a number of large demutualisations, and pressure from carpetbaggers moving from one building society to another to cream off the windfalls, most of the remaining societies modified their rules of membership in the late 1990s. The method usually adopted were membership rules to ensure that anyone newly joining a society would, for the first few years, be unable to get any profit out of a demutualisation. With the chance of a quick profit removed, the wave of demutualisations came to an end in 2000.
One academic study (Heffernan, 2003) found that demutualised societies' pricing behaviour on deposits and mortgages was more favourable to shareholders than to customers, with the remaining mutual building societies offering consistently better rates.[tpl]cite web| title = The Effect of UK Building Society Conversion on Pricing Behaviour (March 2003) | author = Shelagh Heffernan | publisher = Faculty of Finance, CASS Business School, City of London | url = http://www.cass.city.ac.uk/facfin/papers/WP2003/Mutuals-WP.pdf  | format = PDF  | accessdate = 10 October 2007 [/tpl]

===2000s and 2010s===

The Butterfill Act was passed in 2007 giving building societies greater powers to merge with other companies. These powers have been used by the Britannia in 2009 and Kent Reliance in 2011 leading to their demutualisation.
Prior to 31 December 2010, deposits with building societies of up to £50,000 per individual, per institution, were normally protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), but Nationwide and Yorkshire Building Societies negotiated a temporary change to the terms of the FSCS to protect members of the societies they acquired in late 2008/early 2009. The amended terms allowed former members of multiple societies which merge into one to maintain multiple entitlements to FSCS protection until 30 September 2009 (later extended to 30 December 2010), so (for example) a member with £50,000 in each of Nationwide, Cheshire and Derbyshire at the time of the respective mergers would retain £150,000 of FSCS protection for their funds in the merged Nationwide.http://www.moneymadeclear.fsa.gov.uk/news/product/bs_merger_compensation.html On 31 December 2010 the general FSCS limit for retail deposits was increased to £85,000 for banks and building societies and the transitional arrangements in respect of building society mergers came to an end.

====Demutualised====

Ten building societies of the United Kingdom demutualised between 1989 and 2000, either becoming a bank or being acquired by a larger bank.Building Society Takeovers and Flotations Building Societies Association website . Retrieved 5 April 2007. By 2008, every building society that floated on the stock market in the wave of demutualisations of the 1980s and 1990s had either been sold to a conventional bank, or been nationalised.

The following is an incomplete list of building societies in the United Kingdom that no longer exist independently, since they either merged with or were taken over by other building societies or mutuals.Building Society Mergers and Conversions since 1980 Building Societies Association website . Retrieved 5 April 2007. However, they may still have an active presence on the high street (or online) as a trading name or as a distinct brand. This is typically because brands will often build up specific reputations and attract certain clientele, and this can continue to be marketed successfully. 

===Australia===

In Australia, building societies evolved along British lines. Because of strict regulations on banks, building societies flourished until the deregulation of the Australian financial industry in the 1980s. Eventually many of the smaller building societies disappeared, while some of the largest (such as St. George) officially attained the status of banks.
A particular difference between Australian building societies and those elsewhere, is that Australian building societies are required to incorporate as limited companies.

Most merged or dissolved or, in the case of First Active plc, converted into conventional banks. The last remaining building societies, EBS Building Society and Irish Nationwide Building Society, demutualised and were transferred or acquired into Bank subsidiaries in 2011 following the effects of the 2008–2011 Irish financial crisis.

In New Zealand, a number of building societies were established. Some, including Countrywide Building Society and United Building Society, became banks in the 1980s and 1990s. Remaining building societies include:
Registration as a building society in the past where largely a formality.  Nowadays the Registrar of Building Societies seeks that every Building Society has minimum subscribed members with full paid-up capital no less the NZD 200,000 also makes sure all its members fully registered with all companies that are members must not be dormant.  All member companies must have their annual returns lodged, the  registrar’s assessment of any new or old new entity will be based on its compliance with the registrars rules,  The financial soundness of every Building Society must have independent Audited accounts so that the public my assess the risk of dealing with such an institution, as if a part of the registration compliance under the building societies act of 1965.

In Zimbabwe, Central Africa Building Society (CABS) is the leading building society offering a diverse range of financial products and services that include transaction and savings accounts, mobile banking, mortgage loans, money market investments, term deposits and pay-roll loans.

==Similar organisations in other countries==

In other countries there are mutual organisations similar to building societies:

==Operational differences from banks==

Because most building societies were not direct members of the UK clearing system, it was common for them to use a roll number to identify accounts rather than to allocate a six-digit sort-code and eight-digit account number to the BACS standards.
More recently, building societies have tended to obtain sort-code and account number allocations within the clearing system, and hence the use of roll numbers has diminished. When using BACS, one needs to enter roll numbers for the reference field and the building society's generic sort code and account number would be entered in the standard BACS fields.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.experianpayments.com/glossary/roll-number.html |title=Roll Number |publisher= Experianpayments.com [/tpl]

[[Blue Steel (missile)]]

CATEGORIES: Cold War air-to-surface missiles of the United Kingdom, Nuclear air-to-surface missiles, Nuclear weapons of the United Kingdom

The Avro Blue Steel was a British air-launched, rocket-propelled nuclear stand-off missile, built to arm the V bomber force. It was the primary British nuclear deterrent weapon until the Royal Navy started operating Polaris missile armed nuclear submarines.

==Development==

Blue Steel was the result of a Ministry of Supply memorandum from 5 November 1954 that predicted that by 1960 Soviet air defences would make it prohibitively dangerous for V bombers to attack with nuclear gravity bombs. The answer was for a rocket-powered, supersonic missile capable of carrying a large nuclear (or projected thermonuclear) warhead with a range of at least [tpl]convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl]. This would keep the bombers out of range of Soviet ground-based defences installed around the target area, allowing the warhead to "dash" in at high speed.
There would have to be a balance between the size of the warhead, the need for it to be carried by any of the three V-bomber types in use, and that it should be able to reach Mach 3. At the time the only strategic warheads available in the UK were the Orange Herald and Green Bamboo, both of which were very large weapons demanding a large missile fuselage. The Air Staff issued this requirement for a stand-off bomb as OR.1132 in September 1954.Gibson, Buttler T British Secret Projects: Hypersonics, Ramjets and Missiles Midland Publishing 2007
The Ministry of Supply selected Avro out of the British manufacturers though it had no previous experience in working on guided weapons other than some private venture work; Handley Page had suggested a [tpl]convert|500|nmi|km|abbr=on[/tpl] missile but the Elliots gyro based guidance system was inaccurate beyond [tpl]convert|100|nmi|km|abbr=on[/tpl].
Avro began work proper in 1955, with the assigned Rainbow Code name of "Blue Steel" which it would keep in service. With Elliots working on the guidance system Armstrong Siddeley would develop the liquid fuel engine.
Its design period was protracted, with various development problems exacerbated by the fact that designers lacked information on the actual size and weight of the proposed boosted-fission warhead Green Bamboo, or its likely thermonuclear successor derived from the Granite series. The large girth of Blue Steel was determined by the [tpl]convert|45|in|m[/tpl] implosion sphere diameter of Green Bamboo.
Avro proposed that Blue Steel would evolve over time, subsequent versions increasing speed (to Mach 4.5) and range. The ultimate Blue Steel would be a [tpl]convert|900|nmi|km|abbr=on[/tpl] range weapon that could be launched by the supersonic Avro 730 under development. They were told to limit themselves to the specification of OR.1132. The project was delayed by the need to develop the stainless steel fabrication techniques; this would have been gained in building the Avro 730 but that had been cancelled by then. Elliots guidance system was plagued by accuracy problems delaying test flights.
As it turned out, neither of the originally-proposed UK-designed warheads were actually fitted, being superseded by Red Snow, an Anglicised variant of the U.S. W-28 thermonuclear warhead of 1.1 Mt yield. Red Snow was smaller and lighter than the earlier warhead proposals. The missile was fitted with a state-of-the-art inertial navigation unit. This system allowed the missile to strike within 100 metres of its designated target. In addition, the pilots of the Avro Vulcan or Handley Page Victor bombers could tie their systems into those of the missile and make use of the guidance system to help plot their own flight plan, since the unit in the missile was more advanced than that in the aircraft.
Blue Steel emerged as a pilotless, winged aircraft roughly the size of the experimental Saunders-Roe SR.53 interceptor, with clipped delta wings and small canard foreplanes. It was powered by a two-chamber Armstrong Siddeley Stentor Mark 101 rocket engine, burning a combination of hydrogen peroxide and kerosene. The fuel was a considerable operational problem, because fuelling the missile before launch took nearly half an hour, and was quite hazardous.
On launch the rocket engine's first chamber developing [tpl]convert|24000|lbf|kN|abbr=on[/tpl] thrust would power the missile along a predetermined course to the target at around Mach 1.5. Once close to the target, the second chamber of the engine (6,000 lb) would accelerate the missile to Mach 3. Over the target the engine would cut out and the missile would free-fall before detonating its warhead as an air burst.
To speed the trials at Woomera, the test rounds were flown there by Victors and Vulcans in Operation Blue Ranger. The trials began in 1960 about the time the original requirement expected the weapon to be in service.
Blue Steel finally entered service in February 1963, being carried by Vulcans and Victors, although its limitations were already apparent. The short range of the missile meant that the V bombers were still vulnerable to enemy surface-to-air missiles. A replacement for Blue Steel, the Mark 2, was planned with increased range and a ramjet engine, but was cancelled in 1960 to minimise delays to the Mk.1. The UK sought to acquire the much longer-ranged United States Air Force AGM-48 Skybolt air-launched ballistic missile, and was greatly frustrated when that weapon was cancelled in late 1962.
Blue Steel required up to seven hours of launch preparation, and was highly unreliable; the Royal Air Force estimated in 1963 that half the missiles would fail to fire and would have to be dropped over their targets, contradicting their purpose of serving as standoff weapons. Even as it deployed Blue Steel, a high-altitude weapon, that year the government decided that because of anti-aircraft missiles' increasing effectiveness, V bombers would have to convert from high-altitude to low-altitude attacks.[tpl]cite book | title=Ambiguity and Deterrence: British Nuclear Strategy 1945-1964 | publisher=Clarendon Press | author=Baylis, John | year=1995 | location=Oxford | isbn=0-19-828012-2[/tpl][tpl]rp|349–351[/tpl] With no effective long-range weapon the original Blue Steel served on after a crash programme of minor modifications to permit a low-level launch at [tpl]convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl], even though its usefulness in a hot war was likely limited. A stop-gap weapon (WE.177B) was quickly produced to extend the life of the V-bomber force in the strategic role until the Polaris missile was deployed. This WE.177 laydown weapon supplemented the remaining modified Blue Steel missiles using a low-level penetration followed by a pop-up manoeuvre to release the weapon at [tpl]convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] Forty-eight live operational rounds were deployed on 48 Vulcan and Victor bombers plus a further five live rounds as operational spares. An additional four non-nuclear rounds were produced for various RAF requirements, and there were 16 other unspecified training rounds.
Blue Steel was officially retired on 31 December 1970, with the United Kingdom's strategic nuclear capacity passing to the submarine fleet.

[[Branch Davidians]]

CATEGORIES: Branch Davidianism, Adventism, Christian denominations established in the 20th century, United States private paramilitary groups, Religious paramilitary organizations

The Branch Davidians (also known as "The Branch") are a religious group that originated in 1955 from a schism in the Davidian Seventh-day Adventists ("Davidians"), a reform movement that began as an offshoot from the Seventh-day Adventist Church ("Adventists") around 1930. The majority of those who accepted the reform message had been disfellowshipped (removed from membership) from the Seventh-day Adventist Church because of aberrant teachings.
From its inception in 1930, the reform movement believed themselves to be living in a time when Bible prophecies of a final divine judgment were coming to pass as a prelude to Christ's second coming. The name "Branch Davidian" is most widely known for the Waco Siege of 1993 on their property (known as the Mount Carmel Center) near Waco, Texas.  The 51-day siege, by the ATF, FBI, and Texas National Guard, resulted in the deaths of the Branch Davidians' leader, David Koresh, as well as 82 other Branch Davidian men, women, and children, and four ATF agents.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120472/ |title= Waco: The Rules of Engagement (1997) |author1= Gazecki, William |author2= Gifford, Dan |author3= McNulty, Michael |work= Film Documentary |publisher= IMDb - Internet Movie Database |accessdate= 25 November 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title= The Branch Davidians of Waco: The History and Beliefs of an Apocalyptic Sect |author1= Newport, Kenneth G.C. |date= June 22, 2006 |publisher= Oxford University Press |asin= 0199245746 |ISBN= 978-0199245741 |accessdate= 25 November 2012[/tpl]

==History==

In 1929 Victor Houteff, a Bulgarian immigrant and a Seventh-day Adventist Sabbath School teacher in a local church in Southern California, claimed that he had a new message for the entire church. He presented this message in a book, The Shepherd's Rod: The 144,000—A Call for Reformation.[tpl]cite web|author=The General Association of Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists |url=http://www.the-branch.org/Shepherds_Rod_Volume_1_Houteff |title=The Shepherd's Rod, Vol. 1 |publisher=The-branch.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-18[/tpl] The Adventist leadership rejected Houteff's message as contrary to the Adventists' basic teachings and disfellowshipped (removed from membership) Houteff and his followers. However, there was some controversy over the method the leadership took to disfellowship Houteff.

==Koresh group name controversy==

By the time of the siege, Koresh had encouraged his followers to think of themselves as "students of the Seven Seals" rather than as "Branch Davidians." During the standoff one of his followers publicly announced that he wanted them to thereafter be identified by the name "Koreshians"."Mr. Ricks negotiator said today that Ms. Schroeder had told him that members of the sect, a renegade offshoot of Seventh-day Adventists, henceforth wanted to be known as Koreshians."

[[Burwash Hall]]

CATEGORIES: University of Toronto buildings, Gothic Revival architecture in Toronto, University residences in Canada

Burwash Hall is the second oldest of the residence buildings at Toronto's Victoria College.  Construction began in 1911 and was completed in 1913.  It was named after Nathanael Burwash, a former president of Victoria.  The building is an extravagant Neo-Gothic work with turrets, gargoyles, and battlements.  The architect was Henry Sproatt.
The building is divided between the large dining hall in the northwest and the student residence proper.  The residence area is divided into two sections.  The Upper Houses, built in 1913, consist of four houses: North House, Middle House, Gate House, and South House.   The Lower Houses were built in 1931 and were originally intended to house theology students at Emmanuel College, whose current building was opened the same year.  Ryerson House, Nelles House, Caven House, Bowles-Gandier House are now mostly home to undergraduate arts and science students.  The latter two are mostly reserved for students in the new Vic One Programme.
Famous residents of Burwash include Vincent Massey, Lester B. Pearson, Don Harron, and Donald Sutherland.  The upper houses were gutted and renovated in 1995.  The lower houses have only been partially upgraded.  Before the renovations the entire building was all male, but now every house is co-ed.
Each Upper House consists of three floors.  The lower floor contains a common room equipped with kitchen facilities, couches and a television.  The upper floors each have their own kitchen and dining area.  All except North House have a very high bathroom ratio, with Gate House being the best with nine washrooms for its twenty-eight residents.  Upper Houses are divided between double rooms and singles, with about sixty percent of the population being in doubles.
The Lower Houses each have four floors, but are much narrower with each level having only four rooms.  Each level also has its own kitchen, but these are much smaller than in the Upper Houses. The Lower Houses do have far larger and better fitted common rooms that are similar to the ones the Upper Houses had before the renovations.  The rooms in the Lower Houses are also considered more luxurious with hardwood floors and large sizes. Rooms in the Lower Houses are more expensive, however. Until 2003 the Lower Houses were restricted to upper year students but with the double cohort of graduates from Ontario schools many of the rooms were transformed into doubles and now hold first years.
To the west the Upper Houses look out on the Vic Quad and the main Victoria College building across it.  West of the Lower Houses is the new Lester B. Pearson Garden of Peace and International Understanding and the E.J. Pratt Library beyond it.  From the eastern side of the building, the Upper Houses look out at Rowell Jackman Hall and the Lower Houses see the St. Michael's College residence of Elmsley.  The only exception is the view from Gate House's tower that looks down St. Mary's Street.
The dining hall is perhaps the best known part of the building to outsiders.  It is the University of Toronto's largest, holding some 250 students and sixteen large tables.  Hanging on the western wall is Queen Victoria's burial flag, given to the college soon after her death.  Under the flag is the high table where the professors and college administration lunch.  Historically, the Upper Houses each had their own table.  Gate sat in the southwest corner, Middle sat in the far northeast, South sat in the table to the west of Middle, while North sat to the west of the southeast corner. The only lower house to have had a designated table was Caven, in the northwest corner beside the alumni table. (Note that prior to the 1995 renovations, some of these houses, particularly North and Caven, 'traditionally' sat elsewhere)

==Gate House==

Gate House is one of the four Upper Houses of the Burwash Hall residence. Until 2007, when Victoria administration made it co-ed, Gate House was one of the last remaining all-male residence building in the University of Toronto.[tpl]cite web|author=Taylor, Bill|date=2007-12-19|title=Party's over at U of T residence|publisher=Toronto Star''|url=http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/286958|accessdate=2007-12-19[/tpl] The Gate House emblem is the Phoenix, visible in the bottom-right corner of the Victoria College insignia.
Gate House, with the rest of Upper Burwash, opened in 1913 and has held students every year since then except 1995, when it was renovated.[tpl]cite web|author=Houghton, Sarah|date=2003-03-12|title=One Hundred Years of Architecture|publisher=The Strand|url=http://www.vicu.utoronto.ca/about/history/One_Hundred_Years_of_Architecture.htm|accessdate=2007-06-05 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070525051149/http://www.vicu.utoronto.ca/about/history/One_Hundred_Years_of_Architecture.htm  |archivedate = 2007-05-25[/tpl] As an all-male residence from 1913 to 2007 it held a number of unique traditions. For 20 years Gate House hosted an annual party called Novemberfest in the Burwash dining hall.[tpl]cite web|author=Tsang, Sharon|date=2002-12-04|title='Student aspect' of Vic liquor license suspended|publisher=The Strand|url=http://media.www.thestrand.ca/media/storage/paper404/news/2002/12/04/News/student.Aspect.Of.Vic.Liquor.License.Suspended-337730.shtml|accessdate=2007-06-05[/tpl] The Victoria Dean of Students cancelled Novemberfest in 2003, when police discovered widespread underage drinking and over 800 people in the dining hall, in violation of the fire code.[tpl]cite web|author=Salonen, Rachel|date=2002-01-22|title='Student pub taken out of students' hands|publisher=The Strand|url=http://media.www.thestrand.ca/media/storage/paper404/news/2003/01/22/News/Student.Pub.Taken.Out.Of.Students.Hands-350656.shtml|accessdate=2007-06-05[/tpl] Another Gate House tradition that no longer occurs is the "stirring the chicken," a dinner and keg party where house members cook chicken fajitas for hundreds of guests. Until 2007, Gate House held secretive first-year initiation ceremonies called Traditionals, which involved writing slogans on campus buildings in chalk, singing songs to the all-women's residence (who would then sing back to them), and leading first-years around the house blindfolded.[tpl]cite web|author=Bao, Jane|date=2007-01-07|title='Boy's club dismembered|publisher=The Varsity|url=http://www.thevarsity.ca/article/1417|accessdate=2007-01-08[/tpl] Since Novemberfest, Gate House continued to have conflict with the Administration.

Notable residents of Gate House include  Lester B. Pearson, former Prime Minister of Canada, and Simon Pulsifer, who Time Magazine nicknamed "The Duke of Data" for his contributions to Wikipedia.
During its 93 years as a men's residence, Gate House developed a distinct character and reputation. These antics included pranks, toga parties, streaking, caroling to other residences, hazing rituals, "beer bashes" and "incessant pounding" on the Gate House table in the dining hall.[tpl]cite web|author=Richards, Jason|date=2004-09-18|title='Gate House Traditionals Exposed|publisher=The Strand|url=http://media.www.thestrand.ca/media/storage/paper404/news/2002/09/18/Stranded/Gate-House.Traditionals.Exposed-290475.shtml|accessdate=2007-06-05[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Taylor, Bill|date=2007-12-19|title='Party's over at U of T residence|publisher=Toronto Star|url=http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/286958|accessdate=2007-12-19[/tpl] Paul Gooch wrote that these traditions gave Gate House an "ethos" that contradicted his vision of residence life.[tpl]cite web|author=Taylor, Bill|date=2007-12-19|title='Party's over at U of T residence|publisher=Toronto Star''|url=http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/286958|accessdate=2007-12-19[/tpl]

Gate House has three floors which house 28 students, as well as a don and the Victoria College Residence Life Co-ordinator. Above the gate there is a tower that rises three stories higher and has a turret-style roof. The tower is locked during the school year and entering it is a Level 4 offense under the Victoria residence agreement for which the punishment is eviction from residence.
The first floor has one double room and one bathroom available to students. About half of the floor is taken up by the apartment of the Residence Life Coordinator. Lastly, on the first floor there is a house common room with a kitchen and two couches.http://www.vicu.utoronto.ca/Assets/Victoria/assets/Upper_Burwash_1st_Floor_10571_579514.jpg?method=1  The second floor has three double rooms and seven single rooms. It has three single washrooms and one larger communal one, as well as its own kitchen. This floor is home to the residence don, who has a larger room with a private washroom.

[[Benzodiazepine]]

CATEGORIES: Benzodiazepines, Pharmacology, GABA agonists

A benzodiazepine [tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|b|ɛ|n|z|ɵ|d|aɪ|ˈ|æ|z|ɨ|p|iː|n[/tpl] (sometimes colloquially "benzo"; often abbreviated "BZD") is a psychoactive drug whose core chemical structure is the fusion of a benzene ring and a diazepine ring. The first such drug, chlordiazepoxide (Librium), was discovered accidentally by Leo Sternbach in 1955, and made available in 1960 by Hoffmann–La Roche, which has also marketed the benzodiazepine diazepam (Valium) since 1963.
Benzodiazepines enhance the effect of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the GABAA receptor, resulting in sedative, hypnotic (sleep-inducing), anxiolytic (anti-anxiety), anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant properties; also seen in the applied pharmacology of high doses of many shorter-acting benzodiazepines are amnesic-dissociative actions. These properties make benzodiazepines useful in treating anxiety, insomnia, agitation, seizures, muscle spasms, alcohol withdrawal and as a premedication for medical or dental procedures. Benzodiazepines are categorized as either short-, intermediate-, or long-acting. Short- and intermediate-acting benzodiazepines are preferred for the treatment of insomnia; longer-acting benzodiazepines are recommended for the treatment of anxiety.
In general, benzodiazepines are safe and effective in the short term, although cognitive impairments and paradoxical effects such as aggression or behavioral disinhibition occasionally occur. A minority react reverse and contrary to what would normally be expected. For example, a state of panic may worsen considerably following intake of a benzodiazepine. Long-term use is controversial due to concerns about adverse psychological and physical effects, increased questioning of effectiveness, and, because benzodiazepines are prone to cause tolerance, physical dependence, and, upon cessation of use after long-term use, a withdrawal syndrome. Due to adverse effects associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepines, withdrawal from benzodiazepines, in general, leads to improved physical and mental health. The elderly are at an increased risk of suffering from both short- and long-term adverse effects, including an associated roughly 50% increase in the risk of dementia.[tpl]cite journal|last=Billioti de Gage|first=Sophie|coauthors=Bernard Bégaud, Fabienne Bazin, Hélène Verdoux, Jean-François Dartigues, Karine Pérès, Tobias Kurth, Antoine Pariente|title=Benzodiazepine use and risk of dementia: prospective population based study|journal=BMJ|volume=345|pages=e6231|date=September 2012|doi=10.1136/bmj.e6231|pmid=23045258|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/345/bmj.e6231|pmc=3460255[/tpl]
There is controversy concerning the safety of benzodiazepines in pregnancy. While they are not major teratogens, uncertainty remains as to whether they cause cleft palate in a small number of babies and whether neurobehavioural effects occur as a result of prenatal exposure; they are known to cause withdrawal symptoms in the newborn. Benzodiazepines can be taken in overdoses and can cause dangerous deep unconsciousness. However, they are much less toxic than their predecessors, the barbiturates, and death rarely results when a benzodiazepine is the only drug taken; however, when combined with other central nervous system depressants such as alcohol and opiates, the potential for toxicity and fatal overdose increases. Benzodiazepines are commonly misused and taken in combination with other drugs of abuse. In addition, all benzodiazepines are listed in Beers List, which is significant in clinical practice.

===Panic disorder===

Due to their effectiveness, tolerability, and rapid onset of anxiolytic action, benzodiazepines are frequently used for the treatment of anxiety associated with panic disorder.[tpl]cite journal |author=Stevens JC, Pollack MH |title=Benzodiazepines in clinical practice: consideration of their long-term use and alternative agents |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=66 |issue=Suppl 2 |pages=21–27 |year=2005 |pmid=15762816|quote=The frequent use of benzodiazepines for the treatment of anxiety is likely a reflection of their effectiveness, rapid onset of anxiolytic effect, and tolerability.[/tpl] However, there is disagreement among expert bodies regarding the long-term use of benzodiazepines for panic disorder. The views range from those that hold that benzodiazepines are not effective long-term  and that they should be reserved for treatment-resistant cases[tpl]cite journal |author1=Borwin Bandelow |author2=Josef Zohar |author3=Eric Hollander |author4=Siegfried Kasper |author5=Hans-Jürgen Möller |author6=WFSBP Task Force on Treatment Guidelines for Anxiety, Obsessive-Compulsive and Posttraumatic Stress Disorders  |lastauthoramp=1 |title=World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) Guidelines for the Pharmacological Treatment of Anxiety, Obsessive-Compulsive and Posttraumatic Stress Disorders |publisher=Informa Healthcare |journal=The World Journal of Biological Psychiatry |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=171–99 |date=October 2002 |pmid=12516310 |doi= 10.3109/15622970209150621 [/tpl] to that they are as effective in the long term as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
The American Psychiatric Association (APA) guidelines[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.psychiatryonline.com/pracGuide/loadGuidelinePdf.aspx?file=PanicDisorder_2e_PracticeGuideline |format=PDF |title= APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Panic Disorder, Second Edition |author=Work Group on Panic Disorder |date=January 2009 |accessdate=July 12, 2009 [/tpl] note that, in general, benzodiazepines are well tolerated, and their use for the initial treatment for panic disorder is strongly supported by numerous controlled trials. APA states that there is insufficient evidence to recommend any of the established panic disorder treatments over another. The choice of treatment between benzodiazepines, SSRIs, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and psychotherapy should be based on the patient's history, preference, and other individual characteristics. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are likely to be the best choice of pharmacotherapy for many patients with panic disorder, but benzodiazepines are also often used, and some studies suggest that these medications are still used with greater frequency than the SSRIs. One advantage of benzodiazepines is that they alleviate the anxiety symptoms much faster than antidepressants, and therefore may be preferred in patients for whom rapid symptom control is critical. However, this advantage is offset by the possibility of developing benzodiazepine dependence. APA does not recommend benzodiazepines for persons with depressive symptoms or a recent history of substance abuse. The APA guidelines state that, in general, pharmacotherapy of panic disorder should be continued for at least a year, and that clinical experience support continuing benzodiazepine treatment to prevent recurrence. Although major concerns about benzodiazepine tolerance and withdrawal have been raised, there is no evidence for significant dose escalation in patients using benzodiazepines long-term. For many such patients stable doses of benzodiazepines retain their efficacy over several years.
Guidelines issued by the UK-based National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), carried out a systematic review using different methodology and came to a different conclusion. They questioned the accuracy of studies that were not placebo-controlled. And, based on the findings of placebo-controlled studies, they do not recommend use of benzodiazepines beyond two to four weeks, as tolerance and physical dependence develop rapidly, with withdrawal symptoms including rebound anxiety occurring after six weeks or more of use.[tpl]cite web |author=McIntosh A, Cohen A, Turnbull N et al. |title=Clinical guidelines and evidence review for panic disorder and generalised anxiety disorder |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/cg022fullguideline.pdf |publisher=National Collaborating Centre for Primary Care |year=2004 |accessdate=2009-06-16 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |author=Barbui C, Cipriani A |title=Proposal for the inclusion in the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines of a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor for Generalised Anxiety Disorder |url=http://who.int/selection_medicines/committees/expert/17/application/Section24_GAD.pdf |publisher=WHO Collaborating Centre for Research and Training in Mental Health |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-06-23 [/tpl] Nevertheless, benzodiazepines continue to be prescribed for the long-term treatment of anxiety disorders, although specific antidepressants and psychological therapies are recommended as the first-line treatment options with the anticonvulsant drug pregabalin indicated as a second- or third-line treatment and suitable for long-term use.[tpl]cite journal |author=Cloos JM, Ferreira V |title=Current use of benzodiazepines in anxiety disorders |journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=90–95 |year=2009 |pmid=19122540 |doi=10.1097/YCO.0b013e32831a473d [/tpl] NICE stated that long-term use of benzodiazepines for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia is an unlicensed indication, does not have long-term efficacy, and is, therefore, not recommended by clinical guidelines. Psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy are recommended as a first-line therapy for panic disorder; benzodiazepine use has been found to interfere with therapeutic gains from these therapies.
Benzodiazepines are usually administered orally; however, very occasionally lorazepam or diazepam may be given intravenously for the treatment of panic attacks.

===Generalized anxiety disorder===

Benzodiazepines have robust efficacy in the short-term management of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), but were not shown to be effective in producing long-term improvement overall.[tpl]cite journal |author=Martin JL, Sainz-Pardo M, Furukawa TA, Martín-Sánchez E, Seoane T, Galán C |title=Benzodiazepines in generalized anxiety disorder: heterogeneity of outcomes based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials |journal=J. Psychopharmacol. (Oxford) |volume=21 |issue=7 |pages=774–82 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17881433 |doi=10.1177/0269881107077355[/tpl] According to National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), benzodiazepines can be used in the immediate management of GAD, if necessary. However, they should not usually be given for longer than 2–4 weeks. The only medications NICE recommends for the longer term management of GAD are antidepressants.[tpl]cite web |author=|title=Clinical Guideline 22 (amended). Anxiety: management of anxiety (panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, and generalised anxiety disorder) in adults in primary, secondary and community care |pages=23–25| url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG022NICEguidelineamended.pdf |publisher=National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence |year=2007 |accessdate=2009-08-08 [/tpl]
Likewise, Canadian Psychiatric Association (CPA) recommends benzodiazepines alprazolam, bromazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam only as a second-line choice, if the treatment with two different antidepressants was unsuccessful. Although they are second-line agents, benzodiazepines can be used for a limited time to relieve severe anxiety and agitation. CPA guidelines note that after 4–6 weeks the effect of benzodiazepines may decrease to the level of placebo, and that benzodiazepines are less effective than antidepressants in alleviating ruminative worry, the core symptom of GAD. However, in some cases, a prolonged treatment with benzodiazepines as the add-on to an antidepressant may be justified.[tpl]cite journal |author=Canadian Psychiatric Association |title=Clinical practice guidelines. Management of anxiety disorders |journal=Can J Psychiatry |volume=51 |issue=8 Suppl 2 |pages=51S–55S |date=July 2006 |pmid=16933543 |url=http://publications.cpa-apc.org/media.php?mid=440 |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-08-08[/tpl]

===Insomnia===

Benzodiazepines can be useful for short-term treatment of insomnia. Their use beyond 2 to 4 weeks is not recommended due to the risk of dependence. It is preferred that benzodiazepines be taken intermittently and at the lowest effective dose. They improve sleep-related problems by shortening the time spent in bed before falling asleep, prolonging the sleep time, and, in general, reducing wakefulness.[tpl]cite web |author=|title=Technology Appraisal Guidance 77. Guidance on the use of zaleplon, zolpidem and zopiclone for the short-term management of insomnia |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/TA077fullguidance.pdf |publisher=National Institute for Clinical Excellence |date=April 2004|accessdate=2009-07-26[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Ramakrishnan K, Scheid DC |title=Treatment options for insomnia |journal=American Family Physician |volume=76 |issue=4 |pages=517–26 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17853625 |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2007/0815/p517.html [/tpl]
However, they worsen sleep quality by increasing light sleep and decreasing deep sleep. Other drawbacks of hypnotics, including benzodiazepines, are possible tolerance to their effects, rebound insomnia, and reduced slow-wave sleep and a withdrawal period typified by rebound insomnia and a prolonged period of anxiety and agitation.[tpl]Cite book | last1 = D. Maiuro PhD | first1 = Roland | title = Handbook of Integrative Clinical Psychology, Psychiatry, and Behavioral Medicine: Perspectives, Practices, and Research | date = 13 December 2009 | publisher = Springer Publishing Company | url = http://books.google.com/?id=4Tkdm1vRFbUC | isbn = 0-8261-1094-0 | pages = 128–30 [/tpl] The list of benzodiazepines approved for the treatment of insomnia is fairly similar among most countries, but which benzodiazepines are officially designated as first-line hypnotics prescribed for the treatment of insomnia can vary distinctly between countries. Longer-acting benzodiazepines such as nitrazepam and diazepam have residual effects that may persist into the next day and are, in general, not recommended.
It is not clear as to whether the new nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics (Z-drugs) are better than the short-acting benzodiazepines. The efficacy of these two groups of medications is similar. According to the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, indirect comparison indicates that side-effects from benzodiazepines may be about twice as frequent as from nonbenzodiazepines.[tpl]cite web |author=Buscemi N, Vandermeer B, Friesen C, Bialy L, Tubman M, Ospina M, Klassen TP, Witmans M |title=Manifestations and Management of Chronic Insomnia in Adults. Summary, Evidence Report/Technology Assessment: Number 125 | publisher = Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |date=June 2005 |url=http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/epcsums/insomnsum.pdf [/tpl] Some experts suggest using nonbenzodiazepines preferentially as a first-line long-term treatment of insomnia. However, the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence did not find any convincing evidence in favor of Z-drugs. NICE review pointed out that short-acting Z-drugs were inappropriately compared in clinical trials with long-acting benzodiazepines. There have been no trials comparing short-acting Z-drugs with appropriate doses of short-acting benzodiazepines. Based on this, NICE recommended choosing the hypnotic based on cost and the patient's preference.
Older adults should not use benzodiazepines to treat insomnia unless other treatments have failed to be effective.[ref][tpl]Cite journal|author1 =  American Geriatrics Society |author1-link = American Geriatrics Society |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = American Geriatrics Society |work = Choosing Wisely: an initiative of the ABIM Foundation |page = |url = http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-geriatrics-society/ |accessdate = August 1, 2013|postscript = [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl] [/tpl], which cites

===Seizures===

Prolonged convulsive epileptic seizures are a medical emergency that can usually be dealt with effectively by administering fast-acting benzodiazepines, which are potent anticonvulsants. In a hospital environment, intravenous clonazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam are first-line choices, clonazepam due to its stronger and more potent anticonvulsant action, lorazepam due to its faster onset and diazepam for its longer duration of action. In the community, intravenous administration is not practical and so rectal diazepam or (more recently) buccal midazolam are used, with a preference for midazolam as its administration is easier and more socially acceptable.[tpl]cite web |url=http://sign.ac.uk/pdf/sign70.pdf |title=Diagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults |accessdate=2009-06-05 |author=Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network |year=2005 |pages=17–9 [/tpl][tpl]cite book |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG020fullguideline.pdf |title=Clinical Guidelines and Evidence Review for the Epilepsies: diagnosis and management in adults and children in primary and secondary care |accessdate=2009-06-02 |author=Stokes T, Shaw EJ, Juarez-Garcia A, Camosso-Stefinovic J, Baker R |date=October 2004 |publisher=Royal College of General Practitioners |pages=61, 64–65 | location = London [/tpl]
When benzodiazepines were first introduced, they were enthusiastically adopted for treating all forms of epilepsy. However, drowsiness and tolerance become problems with continued use and none are now considered first-line choices for long-term epilepsy therapy.[tpl]cite journal |author=Shorvon SD |title=Drug treatment of epilepsy in the century of the ILAE: the second 50 years, 1959–2009 |journal=Epilepsia |volume=50 |issue=Suppl 3 |pages=93–130 |date=March 2009 |pmid=19298435 |doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2009.02042.x[/tpl] Clobazam is widely used by specialist epilepsy clinics worldwide and clonazepam is popular in the Netherlands, Belgium and France.   It was approved for use in the United States in 2011.  In the UK, both clobazam and clonazepam are second-line choices for treating many forms of epilepsy.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG020fullguideline_appendixB.pdf |title=Clinical Guidelines and Evidence Review for the Epilepsies: diagnosis and management in adults and children in primary and secondary care (Appendix B) |accessdate=2009-06-02 |author=Stokes T, Shaw EJ, Juarez-Garcia A, Camosso-Stefinovic J, Baker R |date=October 2004 |publisher=Royal College of General Practitioners |page=432 | location = London [/tpl] Clobazam also has a useful role for very short-term seizure prophylaxis and in catamenial epilepsy. Discontinuation after long term use in epilepsy requires additional caution because of the risks of rebound seizures. Therefore, the dose is slowly tapered over a period of up to six months or longer.

===Alcohol withdrawal===

Chlordiazepoxide is the most commonly used benzodiazepine for alcohol detoxification,[tpl]cite journal |author=Ashworth M, Gerada C |title=ABC of mental health. Addiction and dependence—II: Alcohol |journal=BMJ |volume=315 |issue=7104 |pages=358–60 |year=1997 |pmid=9270461 |pmc=2127236 |doi=10.1136/bmj.315.7104.358 [/tpl] but diazepam may be used as an alternative. Both are used in the detoxification of individuals who are motivated to stop drinking, and are prescribed for a short period of time to reduce the risks of developing tolerance and dependence to the benzodiazepine medication itself.[tpl]rp|275|date=November 2012[/tpl] The benzodiazepines with a longer half-life make detoxification more tolerable, and dangerous alcohol withdrawal effects are less likely to occur. On the other hand, short-acting benzodiazepines may lead to breakthrough seizures, and are, therefore, not recommended for detoxification in an outpatient setting. Oxazepam and lorazepam are often used in patients at risk of drug accumulation, in particular, the elderly and those with cirrhosis, because they are metabolized differently from other benzodiazepines, through conjugation.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kraemer KL, Conigliaro J, Saitz R |title=Managing alcohol withdrawal in the elderly |journal=Drugs Aging |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=409–25 |year=1999 |pmid=10408740 |doi=10.2165/00002512-199914060-00002 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Prater CD, Miller KE, Zylstra RG |title=Outpatient detoxification of the addicted or alcoholic patient |journal=American Family Physician |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=1175–83 |date=September 1999 |pmid=10507746 |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/990915ap/1175.html [/tpl]
Benzodiazepines are the preferred choice in the management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, in particular, for the prevention and treatment of the dangerous complication of seizures and in subduing severe delirium.[tpl]cite journal |author=Ebell MH |title=Benzodiazepines for alcohol withdrawal |journal=American Family Physician |volume=73 |issue=7 |page=1191 |date=April 2006 |pmid=16623205 |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2006/0401/p1191.html [/tpl] Lorazepam is the only benzodiazepine with predictable intramuscular absorption and it is the most effective in preventing and controlling acute seizures.[tpl]cite journal |author=Peppers MP |title=Benzodiazepines for alcohol withdrawal in the elderly and in patients with liver disease |journal=Pharmacotherapy |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=49–57 |year=1996 |pmid=8700792 [/tpl]

===Anxiety===

Benzodiazepines are sometimes used in the treatment of acute anxiety, as they bring about rapid and marked or moderate relief of symptoms in most individuals; however, they are not recommended beyond 2–4 weeks of use due to risks of tolerance and dependence and a lack of long-term effectiveness. As for insomnia, they may also be used on an irregular/"as-needed" basis, such as in cases where said anxiety is at its worst. Compared to other pharmacological treatments, benzodiazepines are twice as likely to lead to a relapse of the underlying condition upon discontinuation. Psychological therapies and other pharmacological therapies are recommended for the long-term treatment of generalised anxiety disorder. Antidepressants have higher remission rates and are, in general, safe and effective in the short and long term.

===Other indications===

Benzodiazepines are often prescribed for a wide range of conditions:

==Adverse effects==

The most common side-effects of benzodiazepines are related to their sedating and muscle-relaxing action. They include drowsiness, dizziness, and decreased alertness and concentration. Lack of coordination may result in falls and injuries, in particular, in the elderly.[tpl]cite book |author=Ballenger JC |editor=Sadock VA, Sadock BJ, Kaplan HI (eds.) |title=Kaplan & Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry |edition=7th |chapter=Benzodiazepine receptors agonists and antagonists |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |pages=2317–23 |year=2000 |isbn=0-683-30128-4 [/tpl][tpl]cite book |author=Tasman A, Lieberman JA |title=Handbook of Psychiatric Drugs |publisher=Wiley |year=2006 |page=151 |isbn=0-470-02821-1 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Stone KL, Ensrud KE, Ancoli-Israel S | title = Sleep, insomnia and falls in elderly patients | journal = Sleep Med. | volume = 9 Suppl 1 | issue = | pages = S18–22 |date=September 2008 | pmid = 18929314 | doi = 10.1016/S1389-9457(08)70012-1 [/tpl] Another result is impairment of driving skills and increased likelihood of road traffic accidents.[tpl]cite journal |author=Rapoport MJ, Lanctôt KL, Streiner DL |title=Benzodiazepine use and driving: a meta-analysis |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |year=2009 |volume=70 |issue=5 |pages=663–73 |pmid=19389334 |doi=10.4088/JCP.08m04325 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Orriols L, Salmi LR, Philip P |title=The impact of medicinal drugs on traffic safety: a systematic review of epidemiological studies |journal=Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf |year=2009 |pmid=19418468 |doi=10.1002/pds.1763 |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=647–58 |pmc=2780583 [/tpl] Decreased libido and erection problems are a common side effect. Depression and disinhibition may emerge. Hypotension and suppressed breathing may be encountered with intravenous use. Less common side effects include nausea and changes in appetite, blurred vision, confusion, euphoria, depersonalization and nightmares. Cases of liver toxicity have been described but are very rare.[tpl]rp|183–189|date=November 2012[/tpl][tpl]medicinenet|benzodiazepines-oral[/tpl]

===Paradoxical effects===

Paradoxical reactions, such as increased seizures in epileptics,[tpl]Cite journal | last1 = Riss | first1 = J. | last2 = Cloyd | first2 = J. | last3 = Gates | first3 = J. | last4 = Collins | first4 = S. | title = Benzodiazepines in epilepsy: pharmacology and pharmacokinetics | journal = Acta Neurol Scand | volume = 118 | issue = 2 | pages = 69–86 |date=August 2008 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0404.2008.01004.x | pmid = 18384456 [/tpl] aggression, violence, impulsivity, irritability and suicidal behavior sometimes occur. These reactions have been explained as consequences of disinhibition and the subsequent loss of control over socially unacceptable behavior. Paradoxical reactions are rare in the general population, with an incidence rate below 1% and similar to placebo.[tpl]cite journal |author=Saïas T, Gallarda T |title=aggressive reactions to benzodiazepine use: a review |language=French |journal=Encephale |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=330–6 |year=2008 |pmid=18922233 |doi=10.1016/j.encep.2007.05.005 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Paton C |title=Benzodiazepines and disinhibition: a review |journal=Psychiatr Bull R Coll Psychiatr |volume=26 |issue=12 |pages=460–2 |year=2002 |doi=10.1192/pb.26.12.460 |url=http://pb.rcpsych.org/cgi/reprint/26/12/460.pdf [/tpl] However, they occur with greater frequency in recreational abusers, individuals with borderline personality disorder, children, and patients on high-dosage regimes.[tpl]cite journal |author=Bond AJ |title=Drug-induced behavioural disinhibition: incidence, mechanisms and therapeutic implications |journal=CNS Drugs |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=41–57 |year=1998 |doi=10.2165/00023210-199809010-00005 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Drummer OH |title=Benzodiazepines—effects on human performance and behavior |journal=Forensic Sci Rev |volume=14 |issue=1–2 |pages=1–14 |year=2002 [/tpl] In these groups, impulse control problems are perhaps the most important risk factor for disinhibition; learning disabilities and neurological disorders are also significant risks. Most reports of disinhibition involve high doses of high-potency benzodiazepines. Paradoxical effects may also appear after chronic use of benzodiazepines.[tpl]cite book |author=Ashton H |editor=Ayers S, Baum A, McManus C, Newman S (eds.) |title=Cambridge Handbook of Psychology, Health and Medicine |edition=2nd |year=2007 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-87997-2 |pages=675–8 |chapter=Drug dependency: benzodiazepines [/tpl]

===Cognitive effects===

The short-term use of benzodiazepines adversely affects multiple areas of cognition, the most notable one being that it interferes with the formation and consolidation of memories of new material and may induce complete anterograde amnesia. However, researchers hold contrary opinions regarding the effects of long-term administration. One view is that many of the short-term effects continue into the long-term and may even worsen, and are not resolved after quitting benzodiazepines. Another view maintains that cognitive deficits in chronic benzodiazepine users occur only for a short period after the dose, or that the anxiety disorder is the cause of these deficits.
While the definitive studies are lacking, the former view received support from a 2004 meta-analysis of 13 small studies.[tpl]cite journal |author=Barker MJ, Greenwood KM, Jackson M, Crowe SF |title=Cognitive effects of long-term benzodiazepine use: a meta-analysis |journal=CNS Drugs |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=37–48 |year=2004 |pmid=14731058 |doi=10.2165/00023210-200418010-00004[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author= Stewart SA |title= The effects of benzodiazepines on cognition |journal= J Clin Psychiatry |volume=66 |issue= Suppl 2 |pages=9–13 |year=2005 |pmid=15762814 |url=http://psychiatrist.com/supplenet/v66s02/v66s0202.pdf [/tpl] This meta-analysis found that long-term use of benzodiazepines was associated with moderate to large adverse effects on all areas of cognition, with visuospatial memory being the most commonly detected impairment. Some of the other impairments reported were decreased IQ, visiomotor coordination, information processing, verbal learning and concentration. The authors of the meta-analysis and a later reviewer noted that the applicability of this meta-analysis is limited because the subjects were taken mostly from withdrawal clinics; the coexisting drug, alcohol use, and psychiatric disorders were not defined; and several of the included studies conducted the cognitive measurements during the withdrawal period.

===Long-term effects===

The long-term effects of benzodiazepine use can include cognitive impairment as well as affective and behavioural problems. Feelings of turmoil, difficulty in thinking constructively, loss of sex-drive, agoraphobia and social phobia, increasing anxiety and depression, loss of interest in leisure pursuits and interests, and an inability to experience or express feelings can also occur. Not everyone, however, experiences problems with long-term use.[tpl]cite book |editor=Haddad P, Dursun S, Deakin B (eds.) |title=Adverse Syndromes and Psychiatric Drugs: A Clinical Guide |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-852748-0 |pages=239–60 |author=Ashton H |chapter=Benzodiazepine dependence [/tpl][tpl]cite book |editor=Palmer S, Dainow S, Milner P (eds.) |title=Counselling: The BACP Counselling Reader |volume=1 |year=1996 |publisher=Sage |isbn=978-0-8039-7477-7 |pages=211–4 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=wnIBEQKQi7IC |author=Hammersley D, Beeley L |chapter=The effects of medication on counselling [/tpl] Additionally an altered perception of self, environment and relationships may occur.

===Withdrawal syndrome===

====Tolerance, dependence and withdrawal====

The main problem of the chronic use of benzodiazepines is the development of tolerance and dependence. Tolerance manifests itself as diminished pharmacological effect and develops relatively quickly to the sedative, hypnotic, anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant actions of benzodiazepines. Tolerance to anti-anxiety effects develops more slowly with little evidence of continued effectiveness beyond four to six months of continued use. In general, tolerance to the amnesic effects does not occur. However, controversy exists as to tolerance to the anxiolytic effects with some evidence that benzodiazepines retain efficacy[tpl]cite journal |author=Nardi AE, Perna G |title=Clonazepam in the treatment of psychiatric disorders: an update |journal=Int Clin Psychopharmacol |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=131–42 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16528135 |doi=10.1097/01.yic.0000194379.65460.a6 [/tpl] and opposing evidence from a systematic review of the literature that tolerance frequently occurs and some evidence that anxiety may worsen with long-term use. The question of tolerance to the amnesic effects of benzodiazepines is, likewise, unclear.[tpl]cite journal |author=Otto MW, Bruce SE, Deckersbach T |title=Benzodiazepine use, cognitive impairment, and cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders: issues in the treatment of a patient in need |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=66 |issue=Suppl 2 |pages=34–8 |year=2005 |pmid=15762818 |url=http://psychiatrist.com/supplenet/v66s02/v66s0206.pdf [/tpl] Some evidence suggests that partial tolerance does develop, and "the memory impairment is limited to a narrow window within 90 minutes after each dose".[tpl]cite journal |author=Chouinard G |title=Issues in the clinical use of benzodiazepines: potency, withdrawal, and rebound |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=65 |issue=Suppl 5 |pages=7–12 |year=2004 |pmid=15078112 |url=http://psychiatrist.com/supplenet/v65s05/v65s0502.pdf [/tpl]
Discontinuation of benzodiazepines or abrupt reduction of the dose, even after a relatively short course of treatment (three to four weeks), may result in two groups of symptoms — rebound and withdrawal. Rebound symptoms are the return of the symptoms for which the patient was treated but worse than before. Withdrawal symptoms are the new symptoms that occur when the benzodiazepine is stopped. They are the main sign of physical dependence.

====Withdrawal symptoms and management====

The most frequent symptoms of withdrawal from benzodiazepines are insomnia, gastric problems, tremors, agitation, fearfulness, and muscle spasms. The less frequent effects are irritability, sweating, depersonalization, derealization, hypersensitivity to stimuli, depression, suicidal behavior, psychosis, seizures, and delirium tremens.[tpl]cite book |author=Harrison PC, Gelder MG, Cowen P |title=Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry |edition=5th |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |pages=461–2 |chapter=The misuse of alcohol and drugs |isbn=0-19-856667-0 [/tpl] Severe symptoms usually occur as a result of abrupt or over-rapid withdrawal.

Benzodiazepines have a reputation with patients and doctors for causing a severe and traumatic withdrawal; however, this is in large part due to the withdrawal process being poorly managed. Over-rapid withdrawal from benzodiazepines increases the severity of the withdrawal syndrome and increases the failure rate. A slow and gradual withdrawal customised to the individual and, if indicated, psychological support is the most effective way of managing the withdrawal. Opinion as to the time needed to complete withdrawal ranges from four weeks to several years. A goal of less than six months has been suggested, but due to factors such as dosage and type of benzodiazepine, reasons for prescription, lifestyle, personality, environmental stresses, and amount of available support, a year or more may be needed to withdraw.[tpl]rp|183–184|date=November 2012[/tpl]
Withdrawal is best managed by transferring the physically dependent patient to an equivalent dose of diazepam because it has the longest half-life of all of the benzodiazepines, is metabolised into long-acting active metabolites and is available in low-potency tablets, which can be quartered for smaller doses. A further benefit is that it is available in liquid form, which allows for even smaller reductions. Chlordiazepoxide, which also has a long half-life and long-acting active metabolites, can be used as an alternative.[tpl]cite book |url=http://benzo.org.uk/manual/ |title=Benzodiazepines: how they work & how to withdraw (aka The Ashton Manual) |author=Ashton CH |year=2002 |accessdate=2009-05-27 [/tpl][tpl]cite book |author=Lal R, Gupta S, Rao R, Kattimani S |title=Substance Use Disorder |url=http://www.whoindia.org/en/Section20/Section22_1674.htm |accessdate=2009-06-06 |year=2007 |publisher=World Health Organization (WHO) |page=82 |chapter=Emergency management of substance overdose and withdrawal |chapterurl=http://www.whoindia.org/LinkFiles/Mental_Health_&_substance_Abuse_Emergency_management_of_Substance_Overdose_and_Withdrawal-Manual_For_Nursing_Personnel.pdf |quote=Generally, a longer-acting benzodiazepine such as chlordiazepoxide or diazepam is used and the initial dose titrated downward [/tpl]
Nonbenzodiazepines are contraindicated during benzodiazepine withdrawal as they are cross tolerant with benzodiazepines and can induce dependence. Alcohol is also cross tolerant with benzodiazepines and more toxic and thus caution is needed to avoid replacing one dependence with another. During withdrawal, fluoroquinolone-based antibiotics are best avoided if possible; they displace benzodiazepines from their binding site and reduce GABA function and, thus, may aggravate withdrawal symptoms. Antipsychotics are not recommended for benzodiazepine withdrawal (or other CNS depressant withdrawal states) especially clozapine, olanzapine or low potency phenothiazines e.g. chlorpromazine as they lower the seizure threshold and can worsen withdrawal effects; if used extreme caution is required.[tpl]cite book |last1=Ebadi |first1=Manuchair |title=Desk Reference for Clinical Pharmacology |url=http://books.google.com/?id=ihxyHbnj3qYC |edition=2nd |date=23 October 2007 |publisher=CRC Press |location=USA |isbn=978-1-4200-4743-1 |page=512 |chapter=Alphabetical presentation of drugs[/tpl]
Withdrawal from long term benzodiazepines is beneficial for most individuals. Withdrawal of benzodiazepines from long-term users, in general, leads to improved physical and mental health particularly in the elderly; although some long term users report continued benefit from taking benzodiazepines, this may be the result of suppression of withdrawal effects.

==Contraindications==

Because of their muscle relaxant action, benzodiazepines may cause respiratory depression in susceptible individuals. For that reason, they are contraindicated in people with myasthenia gravis, sleep apnea, bronchitis, and COPD. Caution is required when benzodiazepines are used in people with personality disorders or intellectual disability because of frequent paradoxical reactions. In major depression, they may precipitate suicidal tendencies[tpl]cite web |author=Committee on Safety of Medicines |year=1988 |url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&dDocName=CON2024428&RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased |format=PDF |title=Benzodiazepines, dependence and withdrawal symptoms |publisher=Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency |accessdate=2009-05-28 [/tpl] and are sometimes used for suicidal overdoses. Individuals with a history of alcohol, opioid and barbiturate abuse should avoid benzodiazepines, as there is a risk of life-threatening interactions with these drugs.

==Pharmacology==

Benzodiazepines share a similar chemical structure, and their effects in humans are mainly produced by the allosteric modification of a specific kind of neurotransmitter receptor, the GABAA receptor, which increases the overall conductance of these inhibitory channels; this results in the various therapeutic effects as well as adverse effects of benzodiazepines. Other less important mechanisms of action are also known.

===Five types of Benzodiazepines===

===Chemistry===

The term benzodiazepine is the chemical name for the heterocyclic ring system (see figure to the right), which is a fusion between the benzene and diazepine ring systems.[tpl]BlueBook1993 |pages=40–3 [/tpl]; [tpl]cite journal |author=Moss GP |year=1998 |title=Nomenclature of fused and bridged fused ring systems (IUPAC Recommendations 1998) |url=http://media.iupac.org/publications/pac/1998/pdf/7001x0143.pdf |journal=Pure Appl Chem |volume=70 |issue=1 |pages=143–216 |doi=10.1351/pac199870010143 [/tpl] Under Hantzsch–Widman nomenclature, a diazepine is a heterocycle with two nitrogen atoms, five carbon atom and the maximum possible number of cumulative double bonds. The "benzo" prefix indicates the benzene ring fused onto the diazepine ring.
Benzodiazepine drugs are substituted 1,4-benzodiazepines, although the chemical term can refer to many other compounds that do not have useful pharmacological properties. Different benzodiazepine drugs have different side groups attached to this central structure. The different side groups affect the binding of the molecule to the GABAA receptor and so modulate the pharmacological properties. Many of the pharmacologically active "classical" benzodiazepine drugs contain the 5-phenyl-1H-benzoe1,4diazepin-2(3H)-one substructure (see figure to the right).CAS registry number:[tpl]CAS|2898-08-0|1,3-dihydro-5-phenyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one[/tpl]; other names: Ro 05-2921, dechlorodemethyldiazepam. Benzodiazepines have been found to mimic protein reverse turns structurally which enable them with their biological activity in many cases.,[tpl]Cite doi|10.1016/S0040-4020(01)90217-0[/tpl][tpl]Cite doi|10.1007/s10822-006-9059-x[/tpl]
Nonbenzodiazepines also bind to the benzodiazepine binding site on the GABAA receptor and possess similar pharmacological properties. While the nonbenzodiazepines are by definition structurally unrelated to the benzodiazepines, both classes of drugs possess a common pharmacophore (see figure to the lower-right), which explains their binding to a common receptor site.[tpl]cite book |author=Madsen U, Bräuner-Osborne H, Greenwood JR, Johansen TN, Krogsgaard-Larsen P, Liljefors T, Nielsen M, Frølund B |editor=Gad SC |title=Drug Discovery Handbook |publisher=Wiley-Interscience/J.

===Mechanism of action===

Benzodiazepines work by increasing the efficiency of a natural brain chemical, GABA, to decrease the excitability of neurons. This reduces the communication between neurons and, therefore, has a calming effect on many of the functions of the brain.
GABA controls the excitability of neurons by binding to the GABAA receptor.[tpl]cite book |author=Olsen RW, Betz H |editor=Siegel GJ, Albers RW, Brady S, Price DD (eds.) |title=Basic Neurochemistry: Molecular, Cellular and Medical Aspects |edition=7th |publisher=Elsevier |year=2006 |pages=291–302 |chapter=GABA and glycine |isbn=0-12-088397-X [/tpl] The GABAA receptor is a protein complex located in the synapses of neurons. All GABAA receptors contain an ion channel that conducts chloride ions across neuronal cell membranes and two binding sites for the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), while a subset of GABAA receptor complexes also contain a single binding site for benzodiazepines. Binding of benzodiazepines to this receptor complex does not alter binding of GABA. Unlike other positive allosteric modulators that increases ligand binding, benzodiazepine binding acts as a positive allosteric modulator by increasing the total conduction of chloride ions across the neuronal cell membrane when GABA is already bound to its receptor.  This increased chloride ion influx hyperpolarizes the neuron's membrane potential. As a result, the difference between resting potential and threshold potential is increased and firing is less likely.
Different GABAA receptor subtypes have varying distributions within different regions of the brain and, therefore, control distinct neuronal circuits. Hence, activation of different GABAA receptor subtypes by benzodiazepines may result in distinct pharmacological actions.[tpl]cite journal |author=Rudolph U, Möhler H |title=GABA-based therapeutic approaches: GABAA receptor subtype functions |journal=Current Opinion in Pharmacology |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=18–23 |year=2006 |pmid=16376150 |doi=10.1016/j.coph.2005.10.003 [/tpl] In terms of the mechanism of action of benzodiazepines, their similarities are too great to separate them into individual categories such as anxiolytic or hypnotic. For example, a hypnotic administered in low doses will produce anxiety-relieving effects, whereas a benzodiazepine marketed as an anti-anxiety drug will at higher doses induce sleep.[tpl]cite book |last1=Puri |first1=Basant K. |last2=Tyrer |first2=Peter |title=Sciences Basic to Psychiatry |url=http://books.google.com/?id=KTbfRIqjLtUC |accessdate=11-07-2009 |edition=2nd |date=28 August 1998 |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |isbn=978-0-443-05514-0 |pages=155–156 |chapter=Clinical psychopharmacology |chapterurl=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KTbfRIqjLtUC&pg=PA149 [/tpl]
The subset of GABAA receptors that also bind benzodiazepines are referred to as benzodiazepine receptors (BzR). The GABAA receptor is a heteromer composed of five subunits, the most common ones being two αs, two βs, and one γ (α2β2γ). For each subunit, many subtypes exist (α1–6, β1–3, and γ1–3). GABAA receptors that are made up of different combinations of subunit subtypes have different properties, different distributions in the brain and different activities relative to pharmacological and clinical effects.[tpl]cite journal |author=Johnston GA |title=GABAA receptor pharmacology |journal=Pharmacol Ther |volume=69 |issue=3 |pages=173–98 |year=1996 |pmid=8783370 |doi=10.1016/0163-7258(95)02043-8 [/tpl] Benzodiazepines bind at the interface of the α and γ subunits on the GABAA receptor. Binding also requires that alpha subunits contain a histidine amino acid residue, (i.e., α1, α2, α3, and α5 containing GABAA receptors). For this reason, benzodiazepines show no affinity for GABAA receptors containing α4 and α6 subunits with an arginine instead of a histidine residue.[tpl]cite journal |author=Wafford KA, Macaulay AJ, Fradley R, O'Meara GF, Reynolds DS, Rosahl TW |title=Differentiating the role of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor subtypes |journal=Biochem Soc Trans |volume=32 |issue=Pt3 |pages=553–6 |year=2004 |pmid=15157182 |doi=10.1042/BST0320553 [/tpl] Once bound to the benzodiazepine receptor, the benzodiazepine ligand locks the benzodiazepine receptor into a conformation in which it has a greater affinity for the GABA neurotransmitter. This increases the frequency of the opening of the associated chloride ion channel and hyperpolarizes the membrane of the associated neuron. The inhibitory effect of the available GABA is potentiated, leading to sedatory and anxiolytic effects. For instance, those ligands with high activity at the α1 are associated with stronger hypnotic effects, whereas those with higher affinity for GABAA receptors containing α2 and/or α3 subunits have good anti-anxiety activity.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hevers W, Lüddens H |title=The diversity of GABAA receptors.

==Pharmacokinetics==

A benzodiazepine can be placed into one of three groups by its elimination half-life, or time it takes for the body to eliminate half of the dose. Some benzodiazepines have long-acting active metabolites, such as diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, which are metabolised into desmethyldiazepam. Desmethyldiazepam has a half-life of 36–200 hours, and flurazepam, with the main active metabolite of desalkylflurazepam, with a half-life of 40–250 hours. These long-acting metabolites are partial agonists.[tpl]cite book |author=Dikeos DG, Theleritis CG, Soldatos CR |chapter=Benzodiazepines: effects on sleep |pages=220–2 |title=Sleep Disorders: Diagnosis and Therapeutics |editor=Pandi-Perumal SR, Verster JC, Monti JM, Lader M, Langer SZ (eds.) |publisher=Informa Healthcare |year=2008 |isbn=0-415-43818-7 [/tpl]

==Interactions==

Individual benzodiazepines may have different interactions with certain drugs. Depending on their metabolism pathway, benzodiazepines can be divided roughly into two groups. The largest group consists of those that are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes and possess significant potential for interactions with other drugs. The other group comprises those that are metabolized through glucuronidation, such as lorazepam, oxazepam, and temazepam, and, in general, have few drug interactions.[tpl]cite book |editor=Meyler L, Aronson JK |title=Meyler's Side Effects of Drugs: the International Encyclopedia of Adverse Drug Reactions and Interactions |edition=15th |publisher=Elsevier |year=2006 |pages=429–43 |isbn=0-444-50998-4 [/tpl]
Many drugs, including oral contraceptives, some antibiotics, antidepressants, and antifungal agents, inhibit cytochrome enzymes in the liver. They reduce the rate of elimination of the benzodiazepines that are metabolized by CYP450, leading to possibly excessive drug accumulation and increased side-effects. In contrast, drugs that induce cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as St John's wort, the antibiotic rifampicin, and the anticonvulsants carbamazepine and phenytoin, accelerate elimination of many benzodiazepines and decrease their action.[tpl]cite journal |author=Norman TR, Ellen SR, Burrows GD |title=Benzodiazepines in anxiety disorders: managing therapeutics and dependence |journal=Med J Aust |volume=167 |issue=9 |pages=490–5 |year=1997 |pmid=9397065 |url=http://www.mja.com.au/public/mentalhealth/course/06norman.pdf [/tpl] Taking benzodiazepines with alcohol, opioids and other central nervous system depressants potentiates their action. This often results in increased sedation, impaired motor coordination, suppressed breathing, and other adverse effects that have potential to be lethal.[tpl]cite book |author=Moody D |editor=Raymon LP, Mozayani A (eds.) |title=Handbook of Drug Interactions: a Clinical and Forensic Guide |publisher=Humana |year=2004 |pages=3–88 |chapter=Drug interactions with benzodiazepines |isbn=1-58829-211-8 [/tpl] Antacids can slow down absorption of some benzodiazepines; however, this effect is marginal and inconsistent.

==History==

The first benzodiazepine, chlordiazepoxide (Librium), was synthesized in 1955 by Leo Sternbach while working at Hoffmann–La Roche on the development of tranquilizers. The pharmacological properties of the compounds prepared initially were disappointing, and Sternbach abandoned the project. Two years later, in April 1957, co-worker Earl Reeder noticed a "nicely crystalline" compound left over from the discontinued project while spring-cleaning in the lab. This compound, later named chlordiazepoxide, had not been tested in 1955 because of Sternbach's focus on other issues. Expecting the pharmacology results to be negative and hoping to publish the chemistry-related findings, researchers submitted it for a standard battery of animal tests. However, the compound showed very strong sedative, anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant effects. These impressive clinical findings led to its speedy introduction throughout the world in 1960 under the brand name Librium.[tpl]cite journal |author=Sternbach LH |title=The benzodiazepine story |journal=Journal of Medicinal Chemistry |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=1–7 |year=1979 |pmid=34039 |doi=10.1021/jm00187a001 |quote=During this cleanup operation, my co-worker, Earl Reeder, drew my attention to a few hundred milligrams of two products, a nicely crystalline base and its hydrochloride.

The new group of drugs was initially greeted with optimism by the medical profession, but gradually concerns arose; in particular, the risk of dependence became evident in the 1980s. Benzodiazepines have a unique history in that they were responsible for the largest-ever class-action lawsuit against drug manufacturers in the United Kingdom, involving 14,000 patients and 1,800 law firms that alleged the manufacturers knew of the dependence potential but intentionally withheld this information from doctors. At the same time, 117 general practitioners and 50 health authorities were sued by patients to recover damages for the harmful effects of dependence and withdrawal. This led some doctors to require a signed consent form from their patients and to recommend that all patients be adequately warned of the risks of dependence and withdrawal before starting treatment with benzodiazepines.[tpl]cite journal |author=King MB |title=Is there still a role for benzodiazepines in general practice? |journal=Br J Gen Pract |volume=42 |issue=358 |pages=202–5 |year=1992 |pmid=1389432 |pmc=1372025 [/tpl] The court case against the drug manufacturers never reached a verdict; legal aid had been withdrawn and there were allegations that the consultant psychiatrists, the expert witnesses, had a conflict of interest. This litigation led to changes in the British law, making class action lawsuits more difficult.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199899/cmselect/cmhealth/549/99072723.htm |title=Memorandum by Dr Reg Peart |author=Peart R |date=1999-06-01 |work=Minutes of Evidence |publisher=Select Committee on Health, House of Commons, UK Parliament |accessdate=2009-05-27 [/tpl]
In 2010, formerly classified documents from a Medical Research Council (UK) meeting of experts emerged and revealed that the MRC was aware of research 30 years ago that suggested that benzodiazepines could cause brain damage in some people similar to that which occurs from alcohol abuse and failed to follow-up with larger clinical trials. The MRC turned down research proposals in the 1980s by Professor Lader and also proposals by Professor Ashton in 1995 to study whether benzodiazepines had permanent effects on the brain. The MRC responded that it has always been open to research proposals in this area that meet required standards. It was further alleged that the MRC documents were relevant to a large class-action lawsuit, which started in the mid-1980s against drug companies and one solicitor stated that it was strange that the MRC had 'hidden' the documents. Jim Dobbin, MP and chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Involuntary Tranquilliser Addiction, described the documents as a "huge scandal," given the large number of people who experience symptoms such as physical, cognitive, and psychological problems as a result of benzodiazepine use, which can persist even after withdrawing.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/drugs-linked-to-brain-damage-30-years-ago-2127504.html |title=Drugs linked to brain damage 30 years ago |author=Nina Lakhani |date=7 November 2010 |publisher=The Independent on Sunday |location=United Kingdom [/tpl]

On the international scene, benzodiazepines are categorized as Schedule IV controlled drugs by the INCB, apart from flunitrazepam which is a Schedule III drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/green.pdf |title=List of psychotropic substances under international control |accessdate=2008-12-17 |author=International Narcotics Control Board |year=2003 [/tpl] Some variation in drug scheduling exists in individual countries; for example, in the United Kingdom, midazolam and temazepam are Schedule III controlled drugs. British law requires temazepam (but not midazolam) to be stored in safe custody. Safe custody requirements ensures that pharmacists and doctors holding stock of temazepam must store it in securely fixed double-locked steel safety cabinets and maintain a written register, which must be bound and contain separate entries for temazepam and must be written in ink with no use of correction fluid (although a written register is not required for temazepam in the United Kingdom).

Overall, anecdotal evidence suggests that temazepam may be the most psychologically habit-forming (addictive) benzodiazepine. Temazepam abuse reached epidemic proportions in some parts of the world, in particular, in Europe and Australia, and is a major drug of abuse in many Southeast Asian countries.

[[Body mass index]]

The body mass index (BMI), or Quetelet index, is a measure of relative weight based on an individual's mass and height.
Devised between 1830 and 1850 by the Belgian polymath Adolphe Quetelet during the course of developing "social physics",[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1093/ndt/gfm517 |title=Adolphe Quetelet (1796–1874)—the average man and indices of obesity |year=2007 |last1=Eknoyan |first1=Garabed |journal=Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation |volume=23 |issue=1 |pmid=17890752 |pages=47–51[/tpl] it is defined as the individual's body mass divided by the square of their height – with the value universally being given in units of kg/m2.
† The factor for United States customary units is more precisely 703.06957964, but that level of precision is not meaningful for this calculation.
BMI can also be determined using a tablee.g., the Body Mass Index Table from the National Institutes of Health's NHLBI. or from a chart which displays BMI as a function of mass and height using contour lines, or colors for different BMI categories, and may use two different units of measurement.For example, in the UK, where people often know their weight in stone and height in feet and inches – see http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42028000/gif/_42028890_bmi_gra_416x314.gif
The BMI is used in a wide variety of contexts as a simple method to assess how much an individual's body weight departs from what is normal or desirable for a person of his or her height. There is however often vigorous debate, particularly regarding at which value of the BMI scale the threshold for overweight and obese should be set, but also about a range of perceived limitations and problems with the BMI.
Even though many other differently calculated ratios have been invented,Such as the Ponderal index and others given in the "See also" section others haven't been used as often.

==Usage==

While the formula previously called the Quetelet Index for BMI dates to the 19th century, the new term "body mass index" for the ratio and its popularity date to a paper published in the July edition of 1972 in the Journal of Chronic Diseases by Ancel Keys, which found the BMI to be the best proxy for body fat percentage among ratios of weight and height;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2223095/ |title=Beyond BMI: Why doctors won't stop using an outdated measure for obesity |author=Jeremy Singer-Vine |publisher=Slate.com |date=July 20, 2009 |accessdate=15 December 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/0021-9681(72)90027-6 |title=Indices of relative weight and obesity |year=1972 |last1=Keys |first1=Ancel |last2=Fidanza |first2=Flaminio |last3=Karvonen |first3=Martti J. |last4=Kimura |first4=Noboru |last5=Taylor |first5=Henry L. |journal=Journal of Chronic Diseases |volume=25 |issue=6–7 |pmid=4650929 |pages=329–43[/tpl] the interest in measuring body fat being due to obesity becoming a discernible issue in prosperous Western societies. BMI was explicitly cited by Keys as being appropriate for population studies, and inappropriate for individual diagnosis. Nevertheless, due to its simplicity, it came to be widely used for individual diagnosis.
'BMI' provides a simple numeric measure of a person's thickness or thinness, allowing health professionals to discuss overweight and underweight problems more objectively with their patients. However, BMI has become controversial because many people, including physicians, have come to rely on its apparent numerical authority for medical diagnosis, but that was never the BMI's purpose; it is meant to be used as a simple means of classifying sedentary (physically inactive) individuals, or rather, populations, with an average body composition.[tpl]cite journal|journal = WHO Technical Report Series| volume = 854 | title = Physical Status: The Use and Interpretation of Anthropometry |page = 9 |url = http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/WHO_TRS_854.pdf |location=Geneva, Switzerland |year=1995 |publisher=World Health Organization |pmid=8594834[/tpl] For these individuals, the current value settings are as follows: a BMI of 18.5 to 25 may indicate optimal weight, a BMI lower than 18.5 suggests the person is underweight, a number above 25 may indicate the person is overweight, a number above 30 suggests the person is obese.
For a given height, BMI is proportional to mass. However, for a given mass, BMI is inversely proportional to the square of the height. So, if all body dimensions double, and mass scales naturally with the cube of the height, then BMI doubles instead of remaining the same. This results in taller people having a reported BMI that is uncharacteristically high compared to their actual body fat levels. In comparison, the Ponderal index is based on this natural scaling of mass with the third power of the height. However, many taller people are not just "scaled up" short people, but tend to have narrower frames in proportion to their height. Nick Korevaar (a mathematics lecturer from the University of Utah) suggests that instead of squaring the body height (an exponent of 2, as the BMI does) or cubing the body height (an exponent of 3, as the Ponderal index does), it would be more appropriate to use an exponent of between 2.3 and 2.7[tpl]cite web |first=Nick |last=Korevaar |date=July 2003 |url=http://www.math.utah.edu/~korevaar/ACCESS2003/bmi.pdf |title=Notes on Body Mass Index and actual national data[/tpl][tpl]self-published inline|date=July 2012[/tpl][tpl]MEDRS|date=July 2012[/tpl] (as originally noted by Quetelet).  (For a theoretical basis for such values see MacKay.[tpl]cite journal |arxiv=0910.5834 |doi=10.1016/j.jbiomech.2009.10.038 |title=Scaling of human body mass with height: The body mass index revisited |year=2010 |last1=MacKay |first1=N.J. |journal=Journal of Biomechanics |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=764–6 |pmid=19909957 |bibcode=2009arXiv0910.5834M[/tpl])

==BMI Prime==

BMI Prime, a simple modification of the BMI system, is the ratio of actual BMI to upper limit BMI (currently defined at BMI 25). As defined, BMI Prime is also the ratio of body weight to upper body weight limit, calculated at BMI 25. Since it is the ratio of two separate BMI values, BMI Prime is a dimensionless number, without associated units. Individuals with BMI Prime less than 0.74 are underweight; those between 0.74 and 1.00 have optimal weight; and those at 1.00 or greater are overweight. BMI Prime is useful clinically because individuals can tell, at a glance, by what percentage they deviate from their upper weight limits. For instance, a person with BMI 34 has a BMI Prime of 34/25 = 1.36, and is 36% over his or her upper mass limit. In South East Asian and South Chinese populations (see international variation section below) BMI Prime should be calculated using an upper limit BMI of 23 in the denominator instead of 25. Nonetheless, BMI Prime allows easy comparison between populations whose upper limit BMI values differ.[tpl]cite journal |pmid=16768059 |year=2006 |last1=Gadzik |first1=James |title='How much should I weigh?'

==Categories==

A frequent use of the BMI is to assess how much an individual's body weight departs from what is normal or desirable for a person of his or her height. The weight excess or deficiency may, in part, be accounted for by body fat (adipose tissue) although other factors such as muscularity also affect BMI significantly (see discussion below and overweight). The WHO regards a BMI of less than 18.5 as underweight and may indicate malnutrition, an eating disorder, or other health problems, while a BMI greater than 25 is considered overweight and above 30 is considered obese. These ranges of BMI values are valid only as statistical categories

===BMI-for-age===

BMI is used differently for children. It is calculated the same way as for adults, but then compared to typical values for other children of the same age. Instead of set thresholds for underweight and overweight, then, the BMI percentile allows comparison with children of the same sex and age.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/childrens_BMI/about_childrens_BMI.htm|title = Body Mass Index: BMI for Children and Teens|publisher = Center for Disease Control|accessdate = 2013-12-16[/tpl] A BMI that is less than the 5th percentile is considered underweight and above the 95th percentile is considered obese for people 20 and under. People under 20 with a BMI between the 85th and 95th percentile are considered to be overweight.
Recent studies in Britain have indicated that females between the ages 12 and 16 have a higher BMI than males of the same age by 1.0 kg/m2 on average.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.archive2.official-documents.co.uk/document/deps/doh/survey02/summ03.htm|title = Health Survey for England: The Health of Children and Young People|website=Archive2.official-documents.co.uk|accessdate=16 December 2013[/tpl]

===International variations===

These recommended distinctions along the linear scale may vary from time to time and country to country, making global, longitudinal surveys problematic.

====Singapore====

In Singapore, the BMI cut-off figures were revised in 2005, motivated by studies showing that many Asian populations, including Singaporeans, have higher proportion of body fat and increased risk for cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus, compared with Caucasians at the same BMI. The BMI cut-offs are presented with an emphasis on health risk rather than weight.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.hpb.gov.sg/hpb/default.asp?TEMPORARY_DOCUMENT=1769&TEMPORARY_TEMPLATE=2|title = Revision of Body Mass Index (BMI) Cut-Offs in Singapore[/tpl] [tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl]

====United States====

In 1998, the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention brought U.S. definitions into line with World Health Organization guidelines, lowering the normal/overweight cut-off from BMI 27.8 to BMI 25. This had the effect of redefining approximately 29 million Americans, previously healthy to overweight.[tpl]cite news|url = http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/9806/17/weight.guidelines/|title = Who's fat? New definition adopted | publisher=CNN | date=June 17, 1998 |accessdate=2010-04-26[/tpl] It also recommends lowering the normal/overweight threshold for South East Asian body types to around BMI 23, and expects further revisions to emerge from clinical studies of different body types.
The U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of 1994 indicated that 59% of American men and 49% of women had BMIs over 25. Morbid obesity—a BMI of 40 or more—was found in 2% of the men and 4% of the women. The newest survey in 2007 indicates a continuation of the increase in BMI: 63% of Americans are overweight or obese, with 26% now in the obese category (a BMI of 30 or more). There are differing opinions on the threshold for being underweight in females; doctors quote anything from 18.5 to 20 as being the lowest index, the most frequently stated being 19. A BMI nearing 15 is usually used as an indicator for starvation and the health risks involved, with a BMI less than 17.5 being an informal criterion for the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa.

==Health consequences of overweight and obesity in adults==

The BMI ranges are based on the relationship between body weight and disease and death.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/WHO_TRS_854.pdf |journal=WHO Technical Report Series |publisher=World Health Organization |author= |title=Physical status: The use and interpretation of anthropometry |location=Geneva, Switzerland |year=1995 |issue=854 |pmid=8594834 |volume=854 |pages=1–452[/tpl] Overweight and obese individuals are at increased risk for many diseases and health conditions, including the following:[tpl]cite book |chapter=Executive Summary |chapterurl=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK2008/ |pages=xi–xxx |nopp=y |date=September 1998 |title=Clinical Guidelines on the Identification, Evaluation, and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity in Adults: The Evidence Report |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/obesity/ob_gdlns.htm |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute[/tpl]

==Applications==

===Statistical device===

The BMI is generally used as a means of correlation between groups related by general mass and can serve as a vague means of estimating adiposity. The duality of the BMI is that, whilst easy-to-use as a general calculation, it is limited in how accurate and pertinent the data obtained from it can be. Generally, the index is suitable for recognizing trends within sedentary or overweight individuals because there is a smaller margin for errors.[tpl]cite book |last1=Jeukendrup |first1=A. |authorlink1=Asker Jeukendrup |last2=Gleeson |first2=M. |year=2005 |title=Sports Nutrition |publisher=Human Kinetics: An Introduction to Energy Production and Performance |isbn=978-0-7360-3404-3[/tpl][tpl]page needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]
This general correlation is particularly useful for consensus data regarding obesity or various other conditions because it can be used to build a semi-accurate representation from which a solution can be stipulated, or the RDA for a group can be calculated. Similarly, this is becoming more and more pertinent to the growth of children, due to the majority of their exercise habits.[tpl]cite book |last=Barasi |first=M. E. |year=2004 |title=Human Nutrition – a health perspective |isbn=0-340-81025-4[/tpl][tpl]page needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]
The growth of children is usually documented against a BMI-measured growth chart. Obesity trends can be calculated from the difference between the child's BMI and the BMI on the chart.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl]

===Clinical practice===

BMI has been used by the WHO as the standard for recording obesity statistics since the early 1980s. In the United States, BMI is also used as a measure of underweight, owing to advocacy on behalf of those suffering with eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2007[/tpl]
BMI can be calculated quickly and without expensive equipment. However, BMI categories do not take into account many factors such as frame size and muscularity. The categories also fail to account for varying proportions of fat, bone, cartilage, water weight, and more.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
Despite this, BMI categories are regularly regarded as a satisfactory tool for measuring whether sedentary individuals are underweight, overweight or obese with various exemptions, such as: athletes, children, the elderly, and the infirm.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
One basic problem, especially in athletes, is that muscle weight contributes to BMI. Some professional athletes would be overweight or obese according to their BMI, despite carrying little fat, unless the number at which they are considered overweight or obese is adjusted upward in some modified version of the calculation.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl] In children and the elderly, differences in bone density and, thus, in the proportion of bone to total weight can mean the number at which these people are considered underweight should be adjusted downward.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]

===Medical underwriting===

In the United States, where medical underwriting of private health insurance plans is widespread, most private health insurance providers will use a particular high BMI as a cut-off point in order to raise insurance rates for or deny insurance to higher-risk patients, thereby reducing the cost of insurance coverage to all other subscribers in a lower BMI range. The cutoff point is determined differently for every health insurance provider and different providers will have vastly different ranges of acceptability. Many will implement phased surcharges, in which the subscriber will pay an additional penalty, usually as a percentage of the monthly premium, based on membership in an actuarially determined risk tier corresponding to a given range of BMI points above a certain acceptable limit, up to a maximum BMI past which the individual will simply be denied admissibility regardless of price. This can be contrasted with group insurance policies which do not require medical underwriting and where insurance admissibility is guaranteed by virtue of being a member of the insured group, regardless of BMI or other risk factors that would likely render the individual inadmissible to an individual health plan.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2008[/tpl]

==Limitations and shortcomings==

The medical establishment has acknowledged major shortcomings of BMI.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/public/heart/obesity/lose_wt/risk.htm#limitations |title=Aim for a Healthy Weight: Assess your Risk |publisher=National Institutes of Health |date=July 8, 2007 |accessdate=15 December 2013[/tpl] Because the BMI depends upon weight and the square of height, it ignores basic scaling laws whereby mass increases to the 3rd power of linear dimensions. Hence, larger individuals, even if they had exactly the same body shape and relative composition, always have a larger BMI.[tpl]cite journal|author=Taylor, R. S. |year=2010 |title=Use of Body Mass Index For Monitoring Growth and Obesity |journal=Paediatrics & Child Health |volume=15 |issue=5 |page=258 |pmid=21532785 |pmc=2912631[/tpl] Also, its assumptions about the distribution between lean mass and adipose tissue are inexact. BMI generally overestimates adiposity on those with more lean body mass (e.g., athletes) and underestimates excess adiposity on those with less lean body mass. A study in June 2008 by Romero-Corral et al. examined 13,601 subjects from the United States' third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) and found that BMI-defined obesity (BMI > 30) was present in 21% of men and 31% of women. Using body fat percentages (BF%), however, BF%-defined obesity was found in 50% of men and 62% of women. While BMI-defined obesity showed high specificity (95% for men and 99% for women), BMI showed poor sensitivity (36% for men and 49% for women). Despite this undercounting of obesity by BMI, BMI values in the intermediate BMI range of 20–30 were found to be associated with a wide range of body fat percentages. For men with a BMI of 25, about 20% have a body fat percentage below 20% and about 10% have body fat percentage above 30%.
Mathematician Keith Devlin and the restaurant industry association Center for Consumer Freedom argue that the error in the BMI is significant and so pervasive that it is not generally useful in evaluation of health.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.maa.org/devlin/devlin_05_09.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505180701/http://www.maa.org/devlin/devlin_05_09.html |archivedate=2009-05-05 |title=Do You Believe in Fairies, Unicorns, or the BMI? |publisher=Mathematical Association of America |date=May 1, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.rockymounttelegram.com/featr/content/shared/health/stories/BMI_INDEX_0830_COX.html |title=Is obesity such a big, fat threat? |publisher=Cox News Service |date=August 30, 2004 |accessdate=2007-07-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804113535/http://www.rockymounttelegram.com/featr/content/shared/health/stories/BMI_INDEX_0830_COX.html |archivedate = 2007-08-04[/tpl] University of Chicago political science professor Eric Oliver says BMI is a convenient but inaccurate measure of weight, forced onto the populace, and should be revised.[tpl]cite news |url=http://thedartmouth.com/2005/04/26/news/oliver/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804105417/http://thedartmouth.com/2005/04/26/news/oliver/ |archivedate=2009-08-04 |title=Oliver blames 'obesity mafia' for American weight scare |first=Linzi |last=Sheldon |date=April 26, 2005 |newspaper=The Dartmouth[/tpl]

In an analysis of 40 studies involving 250,000 people, patients with coronary artery disease with normal BMIs were at higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease than people whose BMIs put them in the overweight range (BMI 25–29.9).[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69251-9 |title=Association of bodyweight with total mortality and with cardiovascular events in coronary artery disease: A systematic review of cohort studies |year=2006 |last1=Romero-Corral |first1=Abel |last2=Montori |first2=Victor M |last3=Somers |first3=Virend K |last4=Korinek |first4=Josef |last5=Thomas |first5=Randal J |last6=Allison |first6=Thomas G |last7=Mookadam |first7=Farouk |last8=Lopez-Jimenez |first8=Francisco |displayauthors=6 |journal=The Lancet |volume=368 |issue=9536 |pmid=16920472 |pages=666–78[/tpl]
In the overweight, or intermediate, range of BMI (25–29.9), the study found that BMI failed to discriminate between bodyfat percentage and lean mass.

A 2010 study that followed 11,000 subjects for up to eight years concluded that BMI is not a good measure for the risk of heart attack, stroke or death. A better measure was found to be the waist-to-height ratio.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1210/jc.2009-1584 |title=The Predictive Value of Different Measures of Obesity for Incident Cardiovascular Events and Mortality |year=2010 |last1=Schneider |first1=H.

U. |displayauthors=6 |journal=Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism |volume=95 |issue=4 |pmid=20130075 |pages=1777–85[/tpl] However, a 2011 study that followed 60,000 participants for up to 13 years found that waist–hip ratio was a better predictor of ischaemic heart disease mortality.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Mørkedal|first1=Bjørn|last2=Romundstad|first2=Pål R|last3=Vatten|first3=Lars J.|title=Informativeness of indices of blood pressure, obesity and serum lipids in relation to ischaemic heart disease mortality: the HUNT-II study|journal=European Journal of Epidemiology|volume=26|issue=6|year=2011|pages=457–461|issn=0393-2990|doi=10.1007/s10654-011-9572-7|pmid=21461943|pmc=3115050[/tpl]
BMI is particularly inaccurate for people who are fit or athletic, as the higher muscle mass tends to put them in the overweight category by BMI, even though their body fat percentages frequently fall in the 10–15% category, which is below that of a more sedentary person of average build who has a normal BMI number. Body composition for athletes is often better calculated using measures of body fat, as determined by such techniques as skinfold measurements or underwater weighing and the limitations of manual measurement have also led to new, alternative methods to measure obesity, such as the body volume index. However, recent studies of American football linemen who undergo intensive weight training to increase their muscle mass show that they frequently suffer many of the same problems as people ordinarily considered obese, notably sleep apnea.[tpl]cite news |last=Brown |first=David |title=Linemen More Likely To Have Sleep Condition |publisher=The Washington Post |date=January 23, 2003 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-234641.html[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/29/AR2007012900606.html |title=Ex-NFL Linemen prone to Heart Disease |publisher=The Washington Post |date=January 29, 2007 |first=Steven |last=Reinberg |accessdate=2010-04-26[/tpl]
BMI also does not account for body frame size; a person may have a small frame and be carrying more fat than optimal, but their BMI reflects that they are normal. Conversely, a large framed individual may be quite healthy with a fairly low body fat percentage, but be classified as overweight by BMI. Accurate frame size calculators use several measurements (wrist circumference, elbow width, neck circumference and others) to determine what category an individual falls into for a given height. The standard is to use frame size in conjunction with ideal height/weight charts and add roughly 10% for a large frame or subtract roughly 10% for a smaller frame.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl]
For example, a chart may say the ideal weight for a man [tpl]convert|5|ft|10|in|cm|abbr=on[/tpl] is [tpl]convert|165|lb|kg[/tpl]. But if that man has a slender build (small frame), he may be overweight at [tpl]convert|165|lb|kg[/tpl] and should reduce by 10%, to roughly [tpl]convert|150|lb|kg[/tpl]. In the reverse, the man with a larger frame and more solid build can be quite healthy at [tpl]convert|180|lb|kg[/tpl]. If one teeters on the edge of small/medium or medium/large, a dose of common sense should be used in calculating their ideal weight. However, falling into your ideal weight range for height and build is still not as accurate in determining health risk factors as waist/height ratio and actual body fat percentage.
A further limitation of BMI relates to loss of height through aging. In this situation, BMI will increase without any corresponding increase in weight.
The exponent of 2 in the denominator of the formula for BMI is arbitrary. It is meant to reduce variability in the BMI associated only with a difference in size, rather than with differences in weight relative to one's ideal weight. If taller people were simply scaled-up versions of shorter people, the appropriate exponent would be 3, as weight would increase with the cube of height. However, on average, taller people have a slimmer build relative to their height than do shorter people, and the exponent which matches the variation best is less than 3. An analysis based on data gathered in the U.S. suggested an exponent of 2.6 would yield the best fit for children aged 2 to 19 years old. For U.S. adults, exponent estimates range from 1.92 to 1.96 for males and from 1.45 to 1.95 for females.[tpl]cite journal|title=Weight-height relationships and body mass index: some observations from the Diverse Populations Collaboration|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|year=2005|pmid=15761809|doi=10.1002/ajpa.20107|volume=128|issue=1|pages=220–9|author1=Diverse Populations Collaborative Group[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=Physiological models of body composition and human obesity|author=David G Levitt et al.|journal=Nutrition & Metabolism (London)|year=2007|  pmid=17883858|pmc=2082278|first2=SB|first3=RN|first4=SA|first5=JG|volume=4|page=19|doi=10.1186/1743-7075-4-19[/tpl] The exponent 2 is used by convention and for simplicity.
As a possible alternative to BMI, the concepts fat-free mass index (FFMI) and fat mass index (FMI) were introduced in the early 1990s,[tpl]cite journal |pmid=2239792 |year=1990 |last1=Vanitallie |first1=TB |last2=Yang |first2=MU |last3=Heymsfield |first3=SB |last4=Funk |first4=RC |last5=Boileau |first5=RA |title=Height-normalized indices of the body's fat-free mass and fat mass: Potentially useful indicators of nutritional status |volume=52 |issue=6 |pages=953–9 |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition[/tpl] and Body Shape Index in 2012.

===Varying standards===

It is not clear where on the BMI scale the threshold for overweight and obese should be set. Because of this the standards have varied over the past few decades. Between 1980 and 2000 the U.S. Dietary Guidelines have defined overweight at a variety of levels ranging from a BMI of 24.9 to 27.1. In 1985 the National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus conference recommended that overweight BMI be set at a BMI of 27.8 for men and 27.3 for women. In 1988 a NIH report concluded that a BMI over 25 is overweight and a BMI over 30 is obese. In the 1990s the World Health Organization (WHO) decided that a BMI of 25 to 30 should be considered overweight and a BMI over 30 is obese, the standards the NIH set. This became the definitive guide for determining if someone is overweight.
The current WHO and NIH ranges of normal weights are proved to be associated with decreased risks of some diseases such as diabetes type II; however using the same range of BMI for men and women is considered arbitrary, and makes the definition of underweight quite unsuitable for men.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.halls.md/ideal-weight/medical.htm |title=About the 'Medical Recommendation' of Ideal Weight |author=Steven B.

[[Behistun Inscription]]

CATEGORIES: Behistun Inscription, Ancient Persia, Kermanshah Province, Multilingual texts, Archaeological corpora documents, Archaeological sites in Iran, Sculpture of the Ancient Near East

The Behistun Inscription (also Bistun or Bisutun), (Persian: بیستون, Old Persian: Bagastana, meaning "the place of god") is a multi-lingual inscription located on Mount Behistun in the Kermanshah Province of Iran, near the city of Kermanshah in western Iran.
Authored by Darius the Great sometime between his coronation as king of the Persian Empire in the summer of 522 BC and his death in autumn of 486 BC, the inscription begins with a brief autobiography of Darius, including his ancestry and lineage. Later in the inscription, Darius provides a lengthy sequence of events following the deaths of Cyrus the Great and Cambyses II in which he fought nineteen battles in a period of one year (ending in December 521 BC) to put down multiple rebellions throughout the Persian Empire.  The inscription states in detail that the rebellions, which had resulted from the deaths of Cyrus the Great and his son Cambyses II, were orchestrated by several impostors and their co-conspirators in various cities throughout the empire, each of whom falsely proclaimed kinghood during the upheaval following Cyrus's death.
Darius the Great proclaimed himself victorious in all battles during the period of upheaval, attributing his success to the "grace of Ahura Mazda".
The inscription includes three versions of the same text, written in three different cuneiform script languages: Old Persian, Elamite, and Babylonian (a later form of Akkadian). In effect, then, the inscription is to cuneiform what the Rosetta Stone is to Egyptian hieroglyphs: the document most crucial in the decipherment of a previously lost script.
The inscription is approximately 15 metres high by 25 metres wide and 100 metres up a limestone cliff from an ancient road connecting the capitals of Babylonia and Media (Babylon and Ecbatana, respectively). The Old Persian text contains 414 lines in five columns; the Elamite text includes 593 lines in eight columns, and the Babylonian text is in 112 lines. The inscription was illustrated by a life-sized bas-relief of Darius I, the Great, holding a bow as a sign of kingship, with his left foot on the chest of a figure lying on his back before him.  The supine figure is reputed to be the pretender Gaumata.  Darius is attended to the left by two servants, and nine one-metre figures stand to the right, with hands tied and rope around their necks, representing conquered peoples.  Faravahar floats above, giving his blessing to the king. One figure appears to have been added after the others were completed, as was Darius's beard, which is a separate block of stone attached with iron pins and lead.

==History==

After the fall of the Persian Empire's Achaemenid Dynasty and its successors, and the lapse of Old Persian cuneiform writing into disuse, the nature of the inscription was forgotten, and fanciful explanations became the norm. For centuries, instead of being attributed to Darius I, the Great, it was believed to be from the reign of Khosrau II of Persia — one of the last Sassanid kings, who lived over 1000 years after the time of Darius I.
The inscription is mentioned by Ctesias of Cnidus, who noted its existence some time around 400 BC and mentioned a well and a garden beneath the inscription. He incorrectly concluded that the inscription had been dedicated "by Queen Semiramis of Babylon to Zeus". Tacitus also mentions it and includes a description of some of the long-lost ancillary monuments at the base of the cliff, including an altar to "Herakles". What has been recovered of them, including a statue dedicated in 148 BC, is consistent with Tacitus's description. Diodorus also writes of "Bagistanon" and claims it was inscribed by Semiramis.
A legend began around Mount Behistun (Bisutun), as written about by the Persian poet and writer Ferdowsi in his Shahnameh (Book of Kings) [tpl]c.|1000[/tpl], about a man named Farhad, who was a lover of King Khosrow's wife, Shirin. The legend states that, exiled for his transgression, Farhad was given the task of cutting away the mountain to find water; if he succeeded, he would be given permission to marry Shirin. After many years and the removal of half the mountain, he did find water, but was informed by Khosrow that Shirin had died. He went mad, threw his axe down the hill, kissed the ground and died. It is told in the book of Khosrow and Shirin that his axe was made out of a pomegranate tree, and, where he threw the axe, a pomegranate tree grew with fruit that would cure the ill. Shirin was not dead, according to the story, and mourned upon hearing the news.
In 1598, the Englishman Robert Sherley saw the inscription during a diplomatic mission to Persia on behalf of Austria, and brought it to the attention of Western European scholars. His party incorrectly came to the conclusion that it was Christian in origin.E. Denison Ross, The Broadway Travellers: Sir Anthony Sherley and his Persian Adventure, Routledge, 2004, ISBN 0-415-34486-7
French General Gardanne thought it showed "Christ and his twelve apostles", and Sir Robert Ker Porter thought it represented the Lost Tribes of Israel and Shalmaneser of Assyria.http://www.archive.org/download/travelsingeorgia02port/travelsingeorgia02port.pdf Robert Ker Porter, Travels in Georgia, Persia, Armenia, ancient Babylonia, &c. &c. : during the years 1817, 1818, 1819, and 1820, volume 2, Longman, 1821 
Italian explorer Pietro della Valle visited the inscription in the course of a pilgrimage in around 1621CE.

==Translation==

German surveyor Carsten Niebuhr visited in around 1764 for Frederick V of Denmark, publishing a copy of the inscription in the account of his journeys in 1778.Carsten Niebuhr, Reisebeschreibung von Arabien und anderen umliegenden Ländern, 2 volumes, 1774 and 1778
Niebuhr's transcriptions were used by Georg Friedrich Grotefend and others in their efforts to decipher the Old Persian cuneiform script. Grotefend had deciphered ten of the 37 symbols of Old Persian by 1802, after realizing that unlike the Semitic cuneiform scripts, Old Persian text is alphabetic and each word is separated by a vertical slanted symbol.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ancientscripts.com/oldpersian.html |title=Old Persian |publisher=Ancient Scripts |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100418053701/http://www.ancientscripts.com/oldpersian.html| archivedate= 18 April 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
The Old Persian text was copied and deciphered before the recovery and copying of the Elamite and Babylonian inscriptions had even been attempted, which proved to be a good deciphering strategy, since Old Persian script was easier to study due to its alphabetic nature and the fact that the language it represents had naturally evolved into Middle Persian, and in turn, to the living modern Persian language dialects, and was also related to the Avestan language, used in the Zoroastrian book the Avesta.
In 1835, Sir Henry Rawlinson, an officer of the British East India Company army assigned to the forces of the Shah of Iran, began studying the inscription in earnest. As the town of Bisutun's name was anglicized as "Behistun" at this time, the monument became known as the "Behistun Inscription". Despite its relative inaccessibility, Rawlinson was able to scale the cliff and copy the Old Persian inscription. The Elamite was across a chasm, and the Babylonian four meters above; both were beyond easy reach and were left for later.
With the Persian text, and with about a third of the syllabary made available to him by the work of Georg Friedrich Grotefend, Rawlinson set to work on deciphering the text. Fortunately, the first section of this text contained a list of the same Persian kings found in Herodotus in their original Persian forms as opposed to Herodotus's Greek transliterations; for example Darius is given as the original Dâryavuš instead of the Hellenized Δαρειος. By matching the names and the characters, Rawlinson was able to decipher the type of cuneiform used for Old Persian by 1838 and presented his results to the Royal Asiatic Society in London and the Société Asiatique in Paris.
In the interim, Rawlinson spent a brief tour of duty in Afghanistan, returning to the site in 1843. He first crossed a chasm between the Persian and Elamite scripts by bridging the gap with planks, subsequently copying the Elamite inscription. He was then able to find an enterprising local boy to climb up a crack in the cliff and suspend ropes across the Babylonian writing, so that papier-mâché casts of the inscriptions could be taken. Rawlinson, along with several other scholars, most notably Edward Hincks, Julius Oppert, William Henry Fox Talbot, and Edwin Norris, either working separately or in collaboration, eventually deciphered these inscriptions, leading eventually to the ability to read them completely.
The translation of the Old Persian sections of the Behistun Inscription paved the way to the subsequent ability to decipher the Elamite and Babylonian parts of the text, which greatly promoted the development of modern Assyriology.

==Later research and activity==

The site was visited by A. V. Williams Jackson in 1903.A. V. Williams Jackson, The Great Behistun Rock and Some Results of a Re-Examination of the Old Persian Inscriptions on It, Journal of the American Oriental Society, vol. 24, pp. 77-95, 1903
Later expeditions, in 1904 sponsored by the British Museum and led by Leonard William King and Reginald Campbell Thompson and in 1948 by George G. Cameron of the University of Michigan, obtained photographs, casts and more accurate transcriptions of the texts, including passages that were not copied by Rawlinson.http://www.archive.org/download/sculpturesinscri00brituoft/sculpturesinscri00brituoft.pdf W.

It also became apparent that rainwater had dissolved some areas of the limestone in which the text was inscribed, while leaving new deposits of limestone over other areas, covering the text.
In 1938, the inscription became of interest to the Nazi German think tank Ahnenerbe, although research plans were cancelled due to the onset of World War II.
The monument later suffered some damage from Allied soldiers using it for target practice in World War II, during the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran.http://ancientstandard.com/2011/03/30/the-behistun-inscription-the-iranian-rosetta-stone/http://atlantisonline.smfforfree2.com/index.php?topic=2799.5;wap2
In 1999, Iranian archeologists began the documentation and assessment of damages to the site incurred during the 20th century. Malieh Mehdiabadi, who was project manager for the effort, described a photogrammetric process by which two-dimensional photos were taken of the inscriptions using two cameras and later transmuted into 3-D images.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chnpress.com/news/?section=2&id=2589 |title=Documentation of Behistun Inscription Nearly Complete |publisher=Chnpress.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23[/tpl]
In recent years, Iranian archaeologists have been undertaking conservation works.

==Other historical monuments in the Behistun complex==

The site covers an area of 116 hectares. Archeological evidence indicates that this region became a human shelter 40,000 years ago. There are 18 historical monuments other than the inscription of Darius the Great in the Behistun complex that have been registered in the Iranian national list of historical sites. Some of them are:

Image:Seleucid statue of Hercules 2.jpg|Statue of Herakles in Behistun complex
Image:Godarz.jpg|Bas relief of Mithridates II of Parthia and bas relief of Gotarzes II of Parthia and Sheikh Ali khan Zangeneh text endowment

In the first image, Herakles with curly hair and a beard rests on the lion skin. Beside him, an olive tree is seen carved on the wall, while a quiver full of arrows is hanging from it, and a club resting close by. Behind the head of Herakles, an inscription of seven lines in old Greek is written on a smooth space with a frame similar to Greek temples. According to this inscription, the statue was carved in 139 BC on the occasion of a conquest for Seleucid Greeks (under Demetrius II Nicator) against the Parthians (under Mithridates I of Parthia), though the Seleucids were later defeated and driven from the region.
The second image is a bas relief of Mithridates II of Parthia: this was carved in 123–110 BC and represents Parthian king Mithridates and four of his satraps who are respecting the king. Bas relief of Gotarzes II of Parthia shows the conquest of that king over Meherdates, an Arsacid prince who lived in Rome. An inscription in Greek is seen on the left side of the top outer frame of the relief. Sheikh Ali khan Zangeneh text endowment: According to this text, written in Sloth calligraphy, Sheikh Ali khan Zangeneh, a local ruler of the 17th century, dedicates four shares (out of six) of his properties in Ghareh-vali and Chambatan (local villages) for Sadaats (descendants of the prophet Mohammad), and two remaining shares for the Bisotoun Safavid caravansarai.

Barry Morris Goldwater (January 2, 1909Internet Accuracy Project, Senator Barry Goldwater. Retrieved September 23, 2010. – May 29, 1998) was a businessman and five-term United States Senator from Arizona (1953–65, 1969–87) and the Republican Party's nominee for president in the 1964 election. An articulate and charismatic figure during the first half of the 1960s, he was known as "Mr. Conservative".
Goldwater is the politician most often credited for sparking the resurgence of the American conservative political movement in the 1960s. He also had a substantial impact on the libertarian movement.[tpl]Citation | first = Robert | last = Poole | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1568/is_n4_v30/ai_20954419 | title = In memoriam: Barry Goldwater | type = Obituary | newspaper = Reason Magazine |date=August–September 1998[/tpl].
Goldwater rejected the legacy of the New Deal and fought through the conservative coalition against the New Deal coalition. He mobilized a large  conservative constituency to win the hard-fought Republican primaries. Goldwater's conservative campaign platform ultimately failed to gain the support of the electorate[tpl]Sfn | White | 1965 | p = 217[/tpl] and he lost the 1964 presidential election to incumbent Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson by one of the largest landslides in history, bringing down many Republican candidates as well. The Johnson campaign and other critics painted him as a reactionary, while supporters praised his crusades against the Soviet Union, labor unions, and the welfare state. His defeat allowed Johnson and the Democrats in Congress to pass the Great Society programs, but the defeat of so many older Republicans in 1964 also cleared the way for a younger generation of American conservatives to mobilize.  Goldwater was much less active as a national leader of conservatives after 1964; his supporters mostly rallied behind Ronald Reagan, who became governor of California in 1967 and the 40th President of the United States in 1981.
Goldwater returned to the Senate in 1969, and specialized in defense policy, bringing to the table his experience as a senior officer in the Air Force Reserve. In 1974, as an elder statesman of the party, Goldwater successfully urged President Richard Nixon to resign when evidence of a cover-up in the Watergate scandal became overwhelming and impeachment was imminent. By the 1980s, the increasing influence of the Christian right on the Republican Party so conflicted with Goldwater's views that he became a vocal opponent of the religious right on issues such as abortion, gay rights, and the role of religion in public life. A significant accomplishment in his career was the passage of the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986, which restructured the higher levels of the Pentagon by placing the chain of command from the President to the Secretary of Defense directly to the commanders of the Unified Combatant Commands.

==Personal life==

Goldwater was born in Phoenix, in what was then the Arizona Territory, the son of Baron M. Goldwater and his wife, Hattie Josephine ("JoJo") Williams. His father's Jewish family had founded Goldwater's, the largest department store in Phoenix. The family name had been changed from Goldwasser to Goldwater at least as early as the 1860 census in Los Angeles, California. Goldwater's paternal grandparents, Michel and Sarah (Nathan) Goldwasser, had been married in the Great Synagogue of London.[tpl]cite web| first = George | last = Zornik | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1284836.html | title =Thoroughly modern grandmothers |publisher=High beam | accessdate=March 3, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/barrygoldwater.htm | work=The Washington Post | date=May 13, 1997 | accessdate=March 30, 2010 | title= Barry Goldwater[/tpl] Goldwater's mother, who was Protestant, came from an old Yankee family that included the famous theologian, Roger Williams of Rhode Island.[tpl]Sfn | Goldberg | 1995 | pp = 21[/tpl]  Goldwater's parents were married in an Episcopal church in Phoenix; for his entire life, Goldwater was an Episcopalian, though on rare occasions he referred to himself as "Jewish".[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/04/01/specials/goldwater-obit.html | work=The New York Times | accessdate=March 30, 2010 | title=Barry Goldwater, Conservative and Individualist, Dies at 89[/tpl] While he did not often attend church, he stated that "If a man acts in a religious way, an ethical way, then he's really a religious man—and it doesn't have a lot to do with how often he gets inside a church".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,876116,00.html |title=Worship: Goldwater's Faith | work =Time|date=August 28, 1964 |accessdate=March 3, 2012[/tpl][tpl]Sfn | Goldberg | 1995 | pp = 22–27, esp. 27[/tpl]A Jewish essayist famously remarked of Goldwater: [tpl]Citation | last = Golden | first = Harry Golden | quote = I have always thought that if a Jew ever became President, he would turn out to be an Episcopalian. | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,898063,00.html | title = The Taboo | newspaper = Time | date = November 22, 1963[/tpl]
The family department store made the Goldwaters comfortably wealthy. Goldwater graduated from Staunton Military Academy, an elite private school in Virginia, and attended the University of Arizona for one year, where he joined the Sigma Chi fraternity. Barry had never been close to his father, but he took over the family business after Baron's death in 1930. He became a Republican (in a heavily Democratic state), promoted innovative business practices, and opposed the New Deal, especially because it fostered labor unions. Goldwater came to know former president Herbert Hoover, whose conservative politics he admired greatly. In 1934, he married Margaret "Peggy" Johnson, wealthy daughter of a prominent industrialist from Muncie, Indiana. They had four children: Joanne (born January 1, 1936), Barry (born July 15, 1938), Michael (born March 15, 1940), and Peggy (born July 27, 1944). Goldwater became a widower in 1985, and in 1992 he married Susan Wechsler, a nurse 32 years his junior.[tpl]Sfn | Goldberg | 1995 | pp. 41–42, 48–49, 326, 332[/tpl]
With the American entry into World War II, Goldwater received a reserve commission in the United States Army Air Forces. He became a pilot assigned to the Ferry Command, a newly formed unit that flew aircraft and supplies to war zones worldwide. He spent most of the war flying between the USA and India, via the Azores and North Africa or South America, Nigeria, and Central Africa. He also flew "the hump" over the Himalayas to deliver supplies to the Republic of China. Remaining in the Air Force Reserve after the war, he eventually retired as a command pilot with the rank of major general.[tpl]cite web| publisher=US Air Force |title=Major General Barry M Goldwater |url=http://www.af.mil/information/bios/bio.asp?bioID=5574|archiveurl=http://archive.is/QuDi|archivedate=July 29, 2012[/tpl] By that time, he had flown 165 different types of aircraft. Following World War II, Goldwater was a leading proponent of creating the United States Air Force Academy, and later served on the Academy's Board of Visitors. The visitor center at the USAF Academy is now named in his honor. As a colonel he also founded the Arizona Air National Guard, and he would desegregate it two years before the rest of the US military. Goldwater was instrumental in pushing the Pentagon to support desegregation of the armed services.[tpl]cite book|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=-EgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA93&lpg=PA93&dq=goldwater+and+the+desegregation+of+the+arizona+air+national+guard&source=bl&ots=ZpoJA8bHRB&sig=JI8LrknD0ER1FQqg-Q7HQZim7hM&ei=2sYsTci4JIG8lQeP1sywCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=goldwater%20and%20the%20desegregation%20of%20the%20arizona%20air%20national%20guard&f=false | contribution =Life | publisher = Google | title = Books |date=September 18, 1964 |accessdate=March 3, 2012[/tpl]  Goldwater retired as an Air Force major general, and he continued piloting B-52 aircraft until late in his military career.  To those who called him "rash", he would remind people of the old saying that "there are no old, bold pilots".
In 1940, Goldwater became one of the first people to run the Colorado River recreationally through Grand Canyon when he participated as an oarsman on Norman Nevills' second commercial river trip. Goldwater joined the trip in Green River, Utah and rowed his own boat down to Lake Mead.[tpl]Citation | last = Lavender | first = David | title = River Runners of the Grand Canyon | ISBN = 0-8165-0940-9[/tpl]. Goldwater ran track and cross country in high school, where he specialized in the 880 yard run. His parents strongly encouraged him to compete in these sports, to Goldwater's dismay. He often went by the nickname of "Rolling Thunder."
In 1963, he joined the Arizona Society of the Sons of the American Revolution.
In 1970, the Arizona Historical Foundation published the daily journal that Goldwater maintained on the Grand Canyon trip, along with the photographs he took, in a 209 page volume titled [tpl]Citation | title = Delightful Journey | first = Barry | last = Goldwater[/tpl].
Goldwater's son Barry Goldwater, Jr. served as a United States House of Representatives member from California from 1969 to 1983.

==Political career==

In a heavily Democratic state Goldwater became a conservative Republican and a friend of Herbert Hoover.  He was outspoken against New Deal liberalism, especially its close ties to labor unions that he considered corrupt. A pilot, outdoorsman and photographer, he criss-crossed Arizona and developed a deep interest in both the natural history and the human history of the state. He entered Phoenix politics in 1949 when he was elected to the City Council as part of a nonpartisan team of candidates who promised to clean up widespread prostitution and gambling.  The group won every mayoral and council election for two decades. Goldwater rebuilt the weak Republican party and was instrumental in electing Howard Pyle as governor in 1950.Robert Alan Goldberg, Barry Goldwater (1995) pp 67-98 [tpl]cite news| url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/may98/goldwaterchrono.htm | work= The Washington Post | date=June 5, 1998 | accessdate=March 30, 2010 | title=A Look at the Life of Barry Goldwater[/tpl] 
As a Republican he won a seat in the US Senate in 1952, when he upset veteran Democrat and Senate majority leader Ernest McFarland. He defeated McFarland again in 1958, with a strong showing in his first reelection in a year in which the Democrats picked up 13 seats in the Senate. He stepped down from the Senate in 1964 for his presidential campaign.

===Policies===

Goldwater soon became most associated with labor-union reform and anti-communism; he was an active supporter of the conservative coalition in Congress. However, he rejected the wildest fringes of the anti-communist movement; in 1956, he sponsored the passage through the Senate of the final version of the Alaska Mental Health Enabling Act, despite vociferous opposition from opponents who claimed that the Act was a communist plot to establish concentration camps in Alaska. His work on labor issues led to Congress passing major anti-corruption reforms in 1957, and an all-out campaign by the AFL-CIO to defeat his 1958 reelection bid. He voted against the censure of Senator Joseph McCarthy in 1954, but he never actually charged any individual with being a communist/Soviet agent. Goldwater emphasized his strong opposition to the worldwide spread of communism in his 1960 book The Conscience of a Conservative. The book became an important reference text in conservative political circles.
In 1964, Goldwater ran a conservative campaign that emphasized states' rights.[tpl]Sfn | Donaldson | 2003 | p = 20[/tpl]  Goldwater's 1964 campaign was a magnet for conservatives since he opposed interference by the federal government in state affairs. Although he had supported all previous federal civil rights legislation and had supported the original senate version of the bill, Goldwater made the decision to oppose the Civil Rights Act of 1964. His stance was based on his view that the act was an intrusion of the federal government into the affairs of states and that the Act interfered with the rights of private persons to do or not do business with whomever they chose.[tpl]Sfn | Donaldson | 2003 | pp = 152–79[/tpl] In the segregated city of Phoenix in the 1950s, he had quietly supported civil rights for blacks, but would not let his name be used. Goldberg, Barry Goldwater (1995) pp 88-90 
All this appealed to white Southern Democrats, and Goldwater was the first Republican to win the electoral votes of all of the Deep South states (South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana) since  Reconstruction[tpl]Citation | first = Bernard | last = Cosman | title = Five States for Goldwater: Continuity and change in Southern presidential voting patterns | year = 1966[/tpl]. (although Dwight Eisenhower did carry Louisiana in 1956). However, Goldwater's vote on the Civil Rights Act proved devastating to his campaign everywhere outside the South (besides Dixie, Goldwater won only in Arizona, his home state), contributing to his landslide defeat in 1964.
While Goldwater had been depicted by his opponents in the Republican primaries as a representative of a  conservative philosophy that was extreme and alien, his voting records show that his positions were in harmony with those of his fellow Republicans in the Congress. What distinguished him from his predecessors was, according to Hans J. Morgenthau, his firmness of principle and determination, which did not allow him to be content with mere rhetoric.[tpl]Citation | first = Hans J | last = Morgenthau | title = Goldwater-The Romantic Regression | newspaper = Commentary |date=September 1964[/tpl].
Goldwater fought in 1971 to stop US funding of the United Nations after the People's Republic of China was admitted to the organization. He said:
[tpl]quote | I suggested on the floor of the Senate today that we stop all funds for the United Nations. Now, what that'll do to the United Nations, I don't know. I have a hunch it would cause them to fold up, which would make me very happy at this particular point. I think if this happens, they can well move their headquarters to Peking or Moscow and get 'em out of this country."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1971/12295509436546-1/#title |title= Red China Admitted to UN: 1971 Year in Review |publisher=UPI |date=December 28, 1971 |accessdate=March 3, 2012[/tpl][/tpl]

===Elections===

In 1964, he fought and won a bitterly contested, multi-candidate race for the Republican Party's presidential nomination. His main rival was New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, whom he defeated by a narrow margin in the bitterly fought California primary. His nomination was opposed by liberal Republicans, who thought Goldwater's demand for rollback, defeat of the Soviet Union, would foment a nuclear war.  Goldwater  lost to President Lyndon Johnson by a massive landslide, pulling down the GOP, which lost many seats in both houses of Congress. Goldwater carried only his home state and five Deep South states.
Goldwater remained popular in Arizona, and in the 1968 Senate election he was elected (this time) to the seat of retiring Senator Carl Hayden. He was subsequently reelected in 1974 and 1980. The  1974 election saw Goldwater easily reelected. His final campaign in 1980 was close, with Goldwater winning in a near draw against Democratic challenger Bill Schulz. Goldwater said later that the close result convinced him not to run again.[tpl]Citation | url = //www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsuxC6Ft92I | title = You tube | publisher = Google[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2012[/tpl]
Two self-published books advanced the Goldwater cause: [tpl]Citation | title = A Choice, Not An Echo | first = Phyllis | last = Schlafly | author-link = Phyllis Schlafly[/tpl] and [tpl]Citation | title = A Texan Looks at Lyndon: A Study in Illegitimate Power | first = J Evetts | last = Haley | author-link = J. Evetts Haley[/tpl] by a Texas historian. Both were best-sellers but failed to bolster Goldwater's electoral prospects.

===Retirement===

Goldwater seriously considered retirement in 1980 before deciding to run for reelection. Peggy Goldwater reportedly hoped that her husband's Senate term, due to end in January 1981, would be his last. Goldwater decided to run, planning to make the term his last in the Senate. Goldwater faced a surprisingly tough battle for reelection. He was viewed by some as out of touch and vulnerable for several reasons; most importantly, because he had planned to retire in 1981, Goldwater had not visited many areas of Arizona outside of Phoenix and Tucson.  He was also challenged by a formidable opponent, Bill Schulz, a former Republican turned Democrat and a wealthy real estate developer. Schulz was able to infuse massive amounts of money into the campaign from his own fortune.
Arizona's changing population also hurt Goldwater. The state's population had soared, and a huge portion of the electorate had not lived in the state when Goldwater was previously elected; hence, many voters were less familiar with Goldwater's actual beliefs, and he was on the defensive for much of the campaign.  Early returns on election night seemed to indicate that Schulz would win. The counting of votes continued through the night and into the next morning. At around daybreak, Goldwater learned that he had been reelected thanks to absentee ballots, which were among the last to be counted.[tpl]Sfn | Goldberg | 1995 | at = chapter 12[/tpl] Goldwater's surprisingly close victory in 1980 came despite Reagan's 61% landslide over Jimmy Carter in Arizona. Republicans regained control of the Senate, putting Goldwater in the most powerful position he ever had in the Senate.
Goldwater retired in 1987, serving as chair of the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committees in his final term. Despite his reputation as a firebrand in the 1960s, by the end of his career he was considered a stabilizing influence in the Senate, one of the most respected members of either major party. Though Goldwater remained staunchly anti-communist and "hawkish" on military issues, he was a key supporter of the fight for ratification of the Panama Canal Treaty in the 1970s, which would give control of the canal zone to the Republic of Panama. His most important legislative achievement may have been the Goldwater-Nichols Act, which reorganized the US military's senior-command structure.
Goldwater was an active amateur radio "ham" operator, with call letters K7UGA.  Many hams were delighted to make contact with him in his retirement years.

===Political relationships===

Goldwater was grief-stricken[tpl]Sfn | Goldwater | 1980 | p = 161 | ps =: ‘When that assassin's bullet ended the life of John Fitzgerald Kennedy in Dallas on November 22, 1963, it was for me a great personal loss.’[/tpl] by the  assassination of Kennedy and was greatly disappointed that his opponent in the 1964 race would not be Kennedy but instead Kennedy's Vice President, the former Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B.

Goldwater disliked Johnson (who he said "used every dirty trick in the bag"), and Richard M. Nixon of California (whom he later called "the most dishonest individual I have ever met in my life"). Goldwater, after he had again become a senator, advocated for Nixon to resign at the height of Watergate, warning that fewer than ten senators would vote against conviction after Nixon was impeached by the House of Representatives.[tpl]Sfn | Goldberg | 1995 | p = 282[/tpl]  The term "Goldwater moment" has subsequently been used to describe situations when influential members of Congress disagree so strongly with a president from their own party that they rise up and take a stand in opposition.
His 1984 Cable Franchise Policy and Communications Act allowed local governments to require the transmission of public, educational, and government access (PEG) channels, barred cable operators from exercising editorial control over content of programs carried on PEG channels, and absolved them from liability for their content.

====U.S. presidential campaign, 1964====

[[File:1964RepublicanPresidentialPrimaries.svg|thumb|300px|Republican primaries results by state
In South Dakota and Florida, Goldwater finished second to "unpledged delegates", but he finished before all other candidates.]]
At the time of Goldwater's presidential candidacy, the Republican Party was split between its conservative wing (based in the West and South) and moderate/liberal wing (based in the Northeast). He alarmed even some of his fellow partisans with his brand of staunch fiscal conservatism and militant anti-communism. He was viewed by many traditional Republicans as being too far on the right wing of the political spectrum to appeal to the mainstream majority necessary to win a national election. As a result, moderate Republicans recruited a series of opponents, including New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania Governor William Scranton, to challenge Goldwater. Goldwater would defeat Rockefeller in the winner-take-all California primary and secure the nomination.  He also had a solid backing from Southern Republicans.  A bright young  Birmingham lawyer, John Grenier, secured commitments from 271 of 279 southern convention delegates to back Goldwater. Grenier went on to serve as executive director of the national GOP during the Goldwater campaign.  This was the Number 2 position to party chairman Dean Burch, Goldwater's fellow Arizonan.
Goldwater famously declared in his bold acceptance speech at the 1964 Republican Convention, "I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue." This paraphrase of Cicero was included at the suggestion of Harry V. Jaffa, though the speech was primarily written by Karl Hess. Because of President Johnson's popularity, however, Goldwater held back from attacking the president directly; he did not even mention Johnson by name in his convention speech.
Past comments came back to haunt Goldwater throughout his campaign. Once he had called the Eisenhower administration "a dime-store New Deal", and the former president never fully forgave him. Eisenhower did, however, film a television commercial with Goldwater.[tpl]Citation | title = Living room candidate | year = 1964 | url = http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1964/ike-at-gettysburg | contribution = Ike at Gettysburg | publisher = Goldwater | type = campaign ad[/tpl]. Eisenhower qualified his voting for Goldwater in November by remarking that he had voted not specifically for Goldwater, but for the Republican Party.[tpl]Citation needed| date=January 2011[/tpl] In December 1961, Goldwater had told a news conference that "sometimes I think this country would be better off if we could just saw off the Eastern Seaboard and let it float out to sea". That comment boomeranged on him during the campaign in the form of a Johnson television commercial,[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1964/eastern-seabord | year = 1964 | title = Living room candidate | contribution = Eastern Seabord | publisher = Johnson | type = campaign ad[/tpl]. as did remarks about making Social Security voluntary,[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1964/social-security | contribution = Social Security | publisher = Johnson | type = campaign ad | year = 1964 | title = Living room candidate[/tpl]. and statements in Tennessee about selling the Tennessee Valley Authority, a large local New Deal employer.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]
The Goldwater campaign spotlighted Ronald Reagan, who appeared in a campaign ad.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1964/ronald-reagan | publisher =Goldwater | type = ad | work =Living room candidate | contribution = Ronald Reagan | date=September 7, 1964 |accessdate= March 3, 2012[/tpl]  In turn, Reagan gave a stirring, nationally televised speech, "A Time for Choosing", in support of Goldwater.[tpl]Citation | first = Ronald | last = Reagan | url = http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/ronaldreaganatimeforchoosing.htm | title = A Time for Choosing | type = televised address on behalf of Barry Goldwater | date = October 27, 1964 | place = Los Angeles, CA[/tpl]. The speech prompted Reagan to seek the California Governorship in 1966 and jump-started his political career. Conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly, later well known for her fight against the Equal Rights Amendment, first became known for writing a pro-Goldwater book, A Choice, Not an Echo, attacking the moderate Republican establishment.
Former U.S. Senator Prescott Bush, a moderate Republican from Connecticut, was a friend of Goldwater and supported him in the general election campaign. Bush's son, George H. W. Bush (then running for the Senate from Texas against Democrat Ralph Yarborough), was also a strong Goldwater supporter in both the nomination and general election campaigns.
Future Chief Justice of the United States and fellow Arizonan William H. Rehnquist also first came to the attention of national Republicans through his work as a legal adviser to Goldwater's presidential campaign.  Rehnquist had begun his law practice in 1953 in the firm of Denison Kitchel of Phoenix, Goldwater's national campaign manager and friend of nearly three decades.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/oct/24/local/me-kitchel24|title=Denison Kitchel, 94; Ran Goldwater's Presidential Bid|date=October 24, 2002|first=Dennis|last=McLellan|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=June 2, 2013[/tpl]
Goldwater was painted as a dangerous figure by the Johnson campaign, which countered Goldwater's slogan "In your heart, you know he's right" with the lines "In your guts, you know he's nuts", and "In your heart, you know he might" (that is, he might actually use nuclear weapons as opposed to using only deterrence). Johnson himself did not mention Goldwater in his own acceptance speech at the 1964 Democratic National Convention.
Goldwater's provocative advocacy of aggressive tactics to prevent the spread of communism in Asia led to effective counterattacks from Lyndon B. Johnson and his supporters, who claimed that Goldwater's militancy would have dire consequences, possibly even nuclear war. In a May 1964 speech, Goldwater suggested that nuclear weapons should be treated more like conventional weapons and used in Vietnam, specifically that they should have been used at Dien Bien Phu in 1954 to defoliate trees.[tpl]cite journal|title=Nuclear Weapons and the Vietnam War|url=http://www.watsoninstitute.org/pub/vietnam_weapons.pdf|last=Tannenwald |first=Nina|journal=The Journal of Strategic Studies|volume=29|issue=4|year=2006|pages=675–722|doi=10.1080/01402390600766148[/tpl] Regarding Vietnam, Goldwater charged that Johnson's policy was devoid of "goal, course, or purpose", leaving "only sudden death in the jungles and the slow strangulation of freedom".Matthews 2002 Goldwater's rhetoric on nuclear war was viewed by many as quite uncompromising, a view buttressed by off-hand comments such as, "Let's lob one into the men's room at the Kremlin."[tpl]cite web |title=Harper's Magazine |work=Tentacles of Rage |url=http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2004/Republican-Propaganda1sep04.htm[/tpl] He also advocated that field commanders in Vietnam and Europe should be given the authority to use tactical nuclear weapons (which he called "small conventional nuclear weapons") without presidential confirmation.[tpl]Cite book| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rUwEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA11-IA1&dq=goldwater+1964+%22small+conventional+nuclear+weapons%22)+intitle:life&hl=en&sa=X&ei=TQxPT4KGFMmngwftxsXoDQ&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA |title=Our Defense: a Crucial Issue for Candidates |work=Life |date=September 25, 1964 |page=11 |accessdate=March 3, 2012[/tpl]
Goldwater did his best to counter the Johnson attacks, criticizing the Johnson administration for its perceived ethical lapses, and stating in a commercial that "we, as a nation, are not far from the kind of moral decay that has brought on the fall of other nations and people.... I say it is time to put conscience back in government. And by good example, put it back in all walks of American life." Goldwater campaign commercials included statements of support by actor Raymond Massey[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1964/raymond-massey |title=Goldwater ad |publisher=Livingroomcandidate.org |date=September 7, 1964 |accessdate=March 3, 2012[/tpl] and moderate Republican senator Margaret Chase Smith.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1964/senator-margaret-chase |title=Goldwater ad |publisher=Livingroomcandidate.org |date=September 7, 1964 |accessdate=March 3, 2012[/tpl]
Before the 1964 election, the muckraking Fact magazine, published by Ralph Ginzburg, ran a special issue titled "The Unconscious of a Conservative: A Special Issue on the Mind of Barry Goldwater". The two main articles contended that Goldwater was mentally unfit to be president. The magazine attempted to support this claim with the results of an unscientific poll of psychiatrists it had conducted. Fact had mailed questionnaires to 12,356 psychiatrists, and published a "sampling" of the comments made by the 2,417 psychiatrists who responded, of whom 1,189 said Goldwater was unfit to be president. Not one of the psychiatrists had actually interviewed Goldwater himself.[tpl]cite news |author=Richard A.

After the election, Goldwater sued the publisher, the editor and the magazine for libel in Goldwater v. Ginzburg. "Although the jury awarded Goldwater only $1.00 in compensatory damages against all three defendants, it went on to award him punitive damages of $25,000 against Ginzburg and $50,000 against Fact magazine, Inc."[tpl]cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=396&invol=1049 |title=Ginzburg v.

=====Daisy=====

A Democratic campaign advertisement known as Daisy showed a young girl counting daisy petals, from one to ten. Immediately following this scene, a voiceover counted down from ten to one. The child's face was shown as a still photograph followed by images of nuclear explosions and mushroom clouds. The campaign advertisement ended with a plea to vote for Johnson, implying that Goldwater (who was not mentioned by name) would provoke a nuclear war if he was elected. The advertisement, which featured only a few spoken words of narrative and relied on imagery for its emotional impact, was one of the most provocative in American political campaign history, and many analysts credit it as being the birth of the modern style of "negative political ads" on television. The ad aired only once and was immediately pulled, but was then shown many times by television stations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1964/peace-little-girl-daisy |title="Daisy" ad |publisher=Livingroomcandidate.org |date=September 7, 1964 |accessdate=March 3, 2012[/tpl]

=====Results=====

Goldwater only won his home state of Arizona and five states in the Deep South, depicted in red. The Southern states, traditionally Democratic up to that time, voted Republican primarily as a statement of opposition to the Civil Rights Act, which had been passed by Johnson and the Northern Democrats, as well as the majority of Republicans in Congress, earlier that year.Charles S Bullock III, and Mark J. Rozell, The Oxford Handbook of Southern Politics (2012) p 303
In the end, Goldwater received 38.4% of the popular vote, and carried six states: Arizona (with 50.45% of the popular vote) and the core states of the Deep South: Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina. In carrying Georgia by a margin of 54-45, Goldwater became the first Republican nominee to win the state.
In all, Johnson won an overwhelming 486 electoral votes, to Goldwater's 52. Goldwater, with his customary bluntness, remarked, "We would have lost even if Abraham Lincoln had come back and campaigned with us." He maintained later in life that he would have won the election if the country had not been in a state of extended grief (referring to the assassination of John F. Kennedy), and that it was simply not ready for a third President in just 14 months.
Goldwater's poor showing pulled down many supporters. Of the 57 Republican Congressmen who endorsed Goldwater before the convention, 20 were defeated for reelection, along with many promising young Republicans. On the other hand, the defeat of so many older politicians created openings for young conservatives to move up the ladder. While the loss of moderate Republicans was temporary—they were back by 1966—Goldwater also permanently pulled many conservative Southerners and white ethnics out of the New Deal Coalition.Goldberg, Barry Goldwater 232-37
"In the South, Goldwater broke through and won five states—the best showing in the region for a GOP candidate since Reconstruction. In Mississippi—where Franklin D. Roosevelt had won nearly 100 percent of the vote just 28 years earlier—Goldwater claimed a staggering 87 percent."Kornacki, Steve (February 3, 2011) The "Southern Strategy", fulfilled, Salon It has frequently been argued that Goldwater's strong performance in Southern states previously regarded as Democratic strongholds foreshadowed a larger shift in electoral trends in the coming decades that would make the South a Republican bastion (an end to the "Solid South")—first in presidential politics and eventually at the congressional and state levels, as well.[tpl]cite news |first=Daniel |last=Rodriguez |author2=Weingast, Barry |title=How the GOP Helped the Democrats Destroy the Solid South |date=July 2006 |publisher= |url=http://politicalscience.stanford.edu/faculty/documents/weingast-untold%20story%20of%201964%20civil%20rights%20act.pdf |work=Stanford University |pages= |accessdate =January 7, 2007 |language =|format=PDF[/tpl]

===Goldwater and the revival of American conservatism===

Although Goldwater was not as important in the American conservative movement as Ronald Reagan after 1965, he shaped and redefined the movement from the late 1950s to 1964. Arizona Senator John McCain, who had succeeded Goldwater in the Senate in 1987, summed up Goldwater's legacy, "He transformed the Republican Party from an Eastern elitist organization to the breeding ground for the election of Ronald Reagan."[tpl]cite news | last = Grove | first = Lloyd | title = Barry Goldwater's Left Turn | work = The Washington Post | date = July 28, 1994 | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/may98/goldwater072894.htm | accessdate =October 25, 2008[/tpl] Columnist George Will remarked after the 1980 Presidential election that it took 16 years to count the votes from 1964 and Goldwater won.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/05/AR2008110503927.html |title=What Would Goldwater Do?|work=The Washington Post|first=George|last=Will|authorlink=George Will|date=November 6, 2008 |accessdate=March 3, 2012[/tpl]
The Republican Party recovered from the 1964 election debacle, picking up 47 seats in the House of Representatives in the 1966 mid-term election. Further Republican successes ensued, including Goldwater's return to the Senate in 1968. In January of that year, Goldwater wrote an article in the National Review "affirming that he was not against liberals, that liberals are needed as a counterweight to conservatism, and that he had in mind a fine liberal like Max Lerner".Rothbard, Murray N.. "Confessions of a Right-Wing Liberal". Ludwig von Mises Institute.
Goldwater was a strong supporter of the environment. He explained his position in 1969:
Throughout the 1970s, as the conservative wing under Reagan gained control of the party, Goldwater concentrated on his Senate duties, especially in military affairs. He played little part in the election or administration of Richard Nixon, but he helped force Nixon's resignation in 1974.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,942972,00.html |title=The Last Week: The Unmaking of the President|work=Time|date=August 19, 1974 |accessdate=March 3, 2012[/tpl] In 1976 he helped block Rockefeller's renomination as vice president. When Reagan challenged Ford for the presidential nomination in 1976, Goldwater endorsed Ford, looking for consensus rather than conservative idealism. As one historian notes, "The Arizonan had lost much of his zest for battle."Kolkey, Jonathan Martin. The New Right, 1960–1968: With Epilogue, 1969–1980. University Press of America. 1983. quote p. 254Brennan, Mary C. Turning Right in the Sixties: The Conservative Capture of the GOP. University of North Carolina Press. 1995. ch. 6Reinhard, David W. The Republican Right since 1945. University Press of Kentucky. 1983, p. 230.
In 1979, when President Carter normalized relations with Communist China, Goldwater and some other senators sued him in the Supreme Court, arguing that the president could not terminate the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty with Republic of China (Taiwan) without the approval of Congress. The case, Goldwater v. Carter, was dismissed by the court as a political question.

===Later life===

By the 1980s, with Ronald Reagan as president and the growing involvement of the religious right in conservative politics, Goldwater's libertarian views on personal issues were revealed; he believed that they were an integral part of true conservatism. Goldwater viewed abortion as a matter of personal choice, not intended for government intervention.[tpl]Sfn | Goldberg | 1995 | p = 331[/tpl]
As a passionate defender of personal liberty, he saw the religious right's views as an encroachment on personal privacy and individual liberties.[tpl]Sfn | Goldberg | 1995 | p = 315[/tpl]  In his 1980 Senate reelection campaign, Goldwater won support from religious conservatives but in his final term voted consistently to uphold legalized abortion and, in 1981, gave a speech on how he was angry about the bullying of American politicians by religious organizations, and would "fight them every step of the way".[tpl]Citation | url = http://pieceofmind.wordpress.com/2006/11/10/wwbd-what-would-barry-do/ | title = Piece of mind | contribution = WWBD: What Would Barry Do | publisher = Word press | date = November 10, 2006[/tpl].[tpl]Citation | last = Goldwater | newspaper = Los Angeles Times | date = September 17, 1981 | title = The 'New Right' Has Nothing to Do with the 'Old Conservatism'[/tpl].[tpl]Citation | page = 39 | title = The God Delusion[/tpl]. Goldwater also disagreed with the Reagan administration on certain aspects of foreign policy (for example, he opposed the decision to mine Nicaraguan harbors). Notwithstanding his prior differences with Dwight D. Eisenhower, Goldwater in a 1986 interview rated him the best of the seven Presidents with whom he had worked.
On May 12, 1986, Goldwater was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Ronald Reagan.
After his retirement in 1987, Goldwater described the Arizona Governor Evan Mecham as "hardheaded" and called on him to resign, and two years later stated that the Republican party had been taken over by a "bunch of kooks".[tpl]Sfn | Goldberg | 1995 | p = 329[/tpl]
He is a 1987 recipient of the Langley Gold Medal from the Smithsonian Institution. In 1988, in recognition of his career, Princeton University's American Whig-Cliosophic Society awarded Goldwater the James Madison Award for Distinguished Public Service.[tpl]Citation | url = http://archives-trim.un.org/webdrawer/rec/552938/view/Item-in-KAA%20Schoolsuniversities%202002%20-%20oct.%20-%20dec..PDF | title = Item in KAA | format  = PDF | publisher = UN[/tpl].
In a 1994 interview with the Washington Post, the retired senator said,
[tpl]quote |When you say "radical right" today, I think of these moneymaking ventures by fellows like Pat Robertson and others who are trying to take the Republican party and make a religious organization out of it.

Goldwater visited the small town of Bowen, Illinois in 1989 to see first hand where his mother was raised.
In response to Moral Majority founder Jerry Falwell's opposition to the nomination of Sandra Day O'Connor to the Supreme Court, of which Falwell had said, "Every good Christian should be concerned", Goldwater retorted: "Every good Christian ought to kick Falwell right in the ass."[tpl]Citation | first = Ed | last = Magnuson | newspaper = Time | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,954833-2,00.html | title = The Brethren's First Sister | date = July 20, 1981 | accessdate = January 1, 2007[/tpl].Goldberg, Barry Goldwater, p. 315 (According to John Dean, Goldwater actually suggested that good Christians ought to kick Falwell in the "nuts", but the news media "changed the anatomical reference."[tpl]Citation | last = Dean | first = John | title = Broken Government | year = 2008 | publisher = Penguin[/tpl].[tpl]Rp | needed = yes | date =July 2013[/tpl]) Goldwater also had harsh words for his one-time political protegé, President Reagan, particularly after the Iran-Contra Affair became public in 1986. Journalist Robert MacNeil, a friend of Goldwater's from the 1964 Presidential campaign, recalled interviewing him in his office shortly afterward.  "He was sitting in his office with his hands on his cane... and he said to me, 'Well, aren't you going to ask me about the Iran arms sales?' It had just been announced that the Reagan administration had sold arms to Iran. And I said, 'Well, if I asked you, what would you say?'

Some of Goldwater's statements in the 1990s alienated many social conservatives. He endorsed Democrat Karan English in an Arizona congressional race, urged Republicans to lay off Bill Clinton over the Whitewater scandal, and criticized the military's ban on homosexuals: "Everyone knows that gays have served honorably in the military since at least the time of Julius Caesar."[tpl]Citation | title = Ban On Gays Is Senseless Attempt To Stall The Inevitable | newspaper = The Los Angeles Times | url = http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/scotts/bulgarians/barry-goldwater.html | publisher = CMU[/tpl]. He also said, "You don't need to be 'straight' to fight and die for your country. You just need to shoot straight."Goldberg, Barry Goldwater, p. 332 A few years before his death he addressed establishment Republicans by saying, "Do not associate my name with anything you do.

==Hobbies and interests==

===Amateur radio===

Goldwater was an avid amateur radio operator from the early 1920s onwards, with the call signs 6BPI, K3UIG and K7UGA.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.smecc.org/barry_goldwater.htm |title=An Afternoon with Senator Goldwater |publisher=Smecc.org |date= |accessdate=March 3, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/UlsSearch/license.jsp?licKey=262314 |title=FCC K7UGA record |publisher=Wireless2.fcc.gov |date=May 29, 1998 |accessdate=March 3, 2012[/tpl] The latter is now used by an Arizona club honoring him as a commemorative call. During the Vietnam War, he spent many hours giving servicemen overseas the ability to talk to their families at home over the Military Affiliate Radio System (MARS).
Goldwater was also a prominent spokesman for amateur radio and its enthusiasts. Beginning in 1969 up to his death he appeared in numerous educational and promotional films (and later videos) about the hobby that were produced for the American Radio Relay League (the United States national society representing the interests of radio amateurs) by such producers as Dave Bell (W6AQ), ARRL Southwest Director John R. Griggs (W6KW), Alan Kaul (W6RCL), Forrest Oden (N6ENV), and the late Roy Neal (K6DUE). His first appearance was in Dave Bell's "The World of Amateur Radio" where Goldwater discussed the history of the hobby and demonstrated a live contact with Antarctica. His last on-screen appearance dealing with "ham radio" was in 1994, explaining a then-upcoming, Earth-orbiting ham radio relay satellite.
Electronics were a hobby for Goldwater beyond amateur radio. He enjoyed assembling Heathkits, completing more than 100 and often visiting their maker in Benton Harbor, Michigan to buy more, before the company exited the kit business in 1992.Fisher, Lawrence M. "Plug Is Pulled on Heathkits, Ending a Do-It-Yourself Era" The New York Times, March 30, 1992.

===Kachina dolls===

In 1916, Goldwater visited the Hopi Reservation with Phoenix architect John Rinker Kibby, and obtained his first kachina doll. Eventually his doll collection included 437 items and was presented in 1969 to the Heard Museum in Phoenix.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/specials/special25/articles/1203goldwater2.html |title=Goldwater Kachinas a public treasure |publisher=Azcentral.com |date=December 3, 1986 |accessdate=March 3, 2012[/tpl]

===Photography===

Goldwater was an accomplished amateur photographer and in his estate left some 15,000 of his images to three Arizona institutions. He was very keen on candid photography. He got started in photography after receiving a camera as a gift from his wife on their first Christmas together. He was known to use a 4x5 Graflex, Rolleiflex camera,16 MM Bell and Howell motion picture camera, and Nikon FT 35 mm. He was a member of the Royal Photographic Society from 1941 becoming a Life Member in 1948.Information provided by The Royal Photographic Society, United Kingdom, dated October 6, 2011, "Royal Photographic Society".
For decades, he contributed photographs of his home state to Arizona Highways and was best known for his Western landscapes and pictures of native Americans in the United States. Three books with his photographs are People and Places, from 1967; Barry Goldwater and the Southwest, from 1976; and Delightful Journey, first published in 1940 and reprinted in 1970. Ansel Adams wrote a foreword to the 1976 book.Arizona Republic, May 31, 1998
Goldwater's photography interests occasionally crossed over with his political career, as well. John F. Kennedy, as president, was known to invite former congressional colleagues to the White House for a drink. On one occasion, Goldwater brought his camera and photographed President Kennedy. When Kennedy received the photo, he returned it to Goldwater, with the inscription, "For Barry Goldwater – Whom I urge to follow the career for which he has shown such talent – photography! – from his friend – John Kennedy." This quip became a classic of American political humor after it was made famous by humorist Bennett Cerf. The photo itself was prized by Goldwater for the rest of his life, and recently sold for $17,925 in a Heritage auction.[tpl]cite web|url=http://historical.ha.com/common/view_item.php?Sale_No=6047&Lot_No=47197 |title=Heritage Auctions description of signed Kennedy photo |publisher=Historical.ha.com |date=November 17, 2010 |accessdate=March 3, 2012[/tpl]
Son Michael Prescott Goldwater formed the Goldwater Family Foundation with the goal of making his father's photography available via the internet. (Barry Goldwater Photographs) was launched in September 2006 to coincide with the HBO documentary "Mr. Conservative", produced by granddaughter CC Goldwater.

===UFOs===

Goldwater was one of the more prominent American politicians to openly show an interest in UFOs.
On March 28, 1975, Goldwater wrote to Shlomo Arnon: "The subject of UFOs has interested me for some long time. About ten or twelve years ago I made an effort to find out what was in the building at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base where the information has been stored that has been collected by the Air Force, and I was understandably denied this request. It is still classified above Top Secret." Goldwater further wrote that there were rumors the evidence would be released, and that he was "just as anxious to see this material as you are, and I hope we will not have to wait much longer."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.anomalies.net/archive/Text-Archive/txt1/469.ufo |title=FOIA documents | publisher = Anomalies |accessdate=March 3, 2012[/tpl]
The April 25, 1988, issue of The New Yorker carried an interview where Goldwater said he repeatedly asked his friend, Gen. Curtis LeMay, if there was any truth to the rumors that UFO evidence was stored in a secret room at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and if he (Goldwater) might have access to the room. According to Goldwater, an angry LeMay gave him "holy hell" and said, "Not only can't you get into it but don't you ever mention it to me again."[tpl]Citation | first = Burton | last = Bernstein | title = Profiles | contribution = AuH2O | newspaper = The New Yorker | date = April 25, 1988 | page = 43[/tpl].
In a 1988 interview on Larry King's radio show, Goldwater was asked if he thought the U.S. Government was withholding UFO evidence; he replied "Yes, I do." He added:
[tpl]quote | I certainly believe in aliens in space. They may not look like us, but I have very strong feelings that they have advanced beyond our mental capabilities...  I think some highly secret government UFO investigations are going on that we don't know about – and probably never will unless the Air Force discloses them.[tpl]cite web| first =P | last = Cooke |url=http://www.bibleufo.com/quotecong.htm |title=UFO Quotations – The United States Congress |publisher=Bible UFO | accessdate = March 3, 2012[/tpl][/tpl]

[[Baralong incidents]]

CATEGORIES: World War I massacres, Conflicts in 1915, 1915 crimes, Atlantic operations of World War I, Massacres committed by the United Kingdom, Extrajudicial killings, Deaths by firearm in international waters, U-boats involved in international incidents

The Baralong incidents were naval engagements of the First World War in August and September 1915, involving the Royal Navy Q-ship [tpl]HMS|Baralong[/tpl], later renamed HMS Wyandra, and two German U-boats.
Baralong sank [tpl]Ship|SM|U-27|Germany|2[/tpl], which had been preparing to sink a nearby merchant ship, the Nicosian. About a dozen of the crewmen managed to escape the sinking submarine, and Lieutenant Godfrey Herbert, commanding officer of Baralong, ordered the surviving sailors to be summarily executed after they boarded the Nicosian. All the survivors of U-27[tpl]'[/tpl]s sinking, including several who had reached the Nicosian, were shot by Baralong[tpl]'[/tpl]s crew. Later, Baralong sank [tpl]Ship|SM|U-41|Germany|2[/tpl] in an incident which has also been described as a war crime.Coles (1986) p. [tpl]Page needed|date=May 2011[/tpl]Bridgland (1999) pp. 20-55

==First incident==

===Action of 19 August 1915===

After the sinking of [tpl]RMS|Lusitania[/tpl] by a German submarine in May 1915, Lieutenant-Commander Godfrey Herbert, commanding officer of Baralong, was visited by two officers of the Admiralty's Secret Service branch at the naval base at Queenstown, Ireland. He was told, "This Lusitania business is shocking. Unofficially, we are telling you... take no prisoners from U-boats."Bridgland (1999) p. 21
Interviews with his subordinate officers have established Herbert's undisciplined manner of commanding his ship.[tpl]Clarify|the next two statements are an example of off-ship behaviour and subterfuge no necessarily lack of discipline at sea|date=May 2011[/tpl] Herbert allowed his men to engage in drunken binges during shore leave. During one such incident, at Dartmouth, several members of Baralong[tpl]'[/tpl]s crew were arrested after destroying a local saloon. Herbert paid their bail, then left port with the indicted crewmen aboard. Beginning in April 1915, Herbert ordered his subordinates cease calling him "Sir", and to address him only by the pseudonym "Captain William McBride."Messimer (2002) p. 23
Throughout the summer of 1915, Baralong continued routine patrol duties in the Irish Sea without encountering the enemy.
On 19 August 1915, [tpl]SMS|U-24||2|sub=y[/tpl] sank the White Star Liner [tpl]SS|Arabic|1902|6[/tpl] with the loss of 44 lives - this included three Americans and led to a diplomatic incident between Germany and the U.S. Baralong had been about [tpl]convert|20|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] from the scene, and had received a distress call from the ship. Baralong[tpl]'[/tpl]s crew was infuriated by the attack and by their inability to locate survivors.
Meanwhile, about [tpl]convert|100|mi|nmi km|lk=on|abbr=on[/tpl] south of Queenstown, [tpl]Ship|SM|U-27|Germany|2[/tpl], commanded by Kapitänleutnant Bernard Wegener, stopped the British steamer Nicosian in accordance with the rules laid down by the London Declaration. A boarding party of six men from U-27 discovered that Nicosian was carrying munitions and 250 American mules earmarked for the British Army in France. The Germans allowed the freighter's crew and passengers to board lifeboats, and prepared to sink the freighter with the U-boat's deck gun.
U-27 was lying off Nicosian[tpl]'[/tpl]s port quarter and firing into it when Baralong appeared on the scene, flying the ensign of the United States as a false flag. When she was half a mile away, Baralong ran up a signal flag indicating that she was going to rescue Nicosian[tpl]'[/tpl]s crew. Wegener acknowledged the signal, then ordered his men to cease firing, and took U-27 along the port side of Nicosian to intercept Baralong. As the submarine disappeared behind the steamship, Herbert steered Baralong on a parallel course along Nicosian[tpl]'[/tpl]s starboard side.Messimer (2002) pp. 46–47
Before U-27 came round Nicosian[tpl]'[/tpl]s bow, Baralong hauled down the American flag, hoisted the Royal Navy's White Ensign, and unmasked her guns. As U-27 came into view from behind Nicosian, Baralong opened fire with her three 12-pounder guns at a range of [tpl]convert|600|yd|abbr=on[/tpl], firing 34 rounds for only a single shot from the submarine. U-27 rolled over and began to sink.O'Neill (2006) p. 9
According to Tony Bridgland;  "Herbert screamed, 'Cease fire!' But his men's blood was up. They were avenging the Arabic and the Lusitania. For them this was no time to cease firing, even as the survivors of the crew appeared on the outer casing, struggling out of their clothes to swim away from her. There was a mighty hiss of compressed air from her tanks and the U-27 vanished from sight in a vortex of giant rumbling bubbles, leaving a pall of smoke over the spot where she had been. It had taken only a few minutes to fire the thirty-four shells into her."Messimer (2002) pp. 29-30 
Meanwhile, Nicosian[tpl]'[/tpl]s crew were cheering wildly from the lifeboats. Captain Manning was heard to yell, "If any of those bastard Huns come up, lads, hit 'em with an oar!"Messimer (2002) p. 30
Twelve men survived the sinking of the submarine: the crews of her two deck guns and those who had been on the conning tower. They swam to Nicosian and attempted to join the six-man boarding party by climbing up her hanging lifeboat fallsThe ropes by which a boat is lowered from the deck of a ship to the water and pilot ladder. Herbert, worried that they might try to scuttle the steamer, ordered his men to open fire with small arms, killing all in the water.Gibson & Prendergast, p. 53Grant (2002) p. 27Halpern (1994) p. 301 Wegener is described by some accounts as being shot while trying to swim to the Baralong.
Herbert sent Baralong[tpl]'[/tpl]s 12 Royal Marines, under the command of a Corporal Collins, to find the surviving German sailors aboard Nicosian. As they departed, Herbert told Collins, "Take no prisoners."Messimer (2002) p. 42 The Germans were discovered in the engine room and shot on sight. According to Sub-Lieutenant Gordon Steele: "Wegener ran to a cabin on the upper deck -- I later found out it was Manning's bathroom. The marines broke down the door with the butts of their rifles, but Wegener squeezes through a scuttle and dropped into the sea. He still had his life-jacket on and put up his arms in surrender. Corporal Collins, however, took aim and shot him through the head."Bridgland (1999) p. 43 Corporal Collins later recalled that, after Wegener's death, Herbert threw a revolver in the German captain's face and screamed, "What about the Lusitania, you bastard!" An alternative account says that the Germans who boarded Nicosian were killed by the freighter's engine room staff; this report apparently came from the officer in command of the muleteers.McGill & Norris (2007) pp. 320-1

===Aftermath===

In Herbert's report to the Admiralty, he stated he feared the survivors from the U-boat's crew would board the freighter and scuttle her, so he ordered the Royal Marines on his ship to shoot the survivors. If they had scuttled the freighter, it could have been counted as negligence on the part of Herbert. Moments before Baralong began her attack, the submarine was firing on the freighter. It is not known if the escaping sailors actually intended to scuttle the freighter.
The Admiralty, upon receiving Herbert's report, immediately ordered its suppression, but the strict censorship imposed on the event failed when Americans who had witnessed the incident from Nicosian[tpl]'[/tpl]s lifeboats spoke to newspaper reporters after their return to the United States.Halpern [tpl]Page needed|date=May 2011[/tpl]

===German memorandum===

The German government delivered a memorandum on the incident via the American ambassador in Berlin, who received it on 6 December 1915. In it, they cited six US citizens as witnesses, stating they had made sworn depositions regarding the incident before public notaries in the US.
The statements said that five survivors from U-27 managed to board Nicosian, while the rest were shot and killed on Herbert's orders while clinging to the merchant vessel's lifeboat falls. It was further stated that when Herbert ordered his Marines to board Nicosian, he gave the order "take no prisoners". Four German sailors were found in Nicosian[tpl]'[/tpl]s engine room and propeller shaft tunnel, and were killed. According to the witness statements, U-27[tpl]'[/tpl]s commander was shot while swimming towards Baralong.[tpl]cite web |title=Memorandum of the German Government...and reply of His Majesty's Government thereto|work= |publisher=WWW Virtual Library |date= |url=http://www.vlib.us/wwi/resources/archives/texts/t050925/Baralong.html |accessdate=8 December 2012[/tpl]the British reply is not included
The memorandum demanded that the captain and crew of Baralong be tried for the murder of unarmed German sailors, threatening to "take the serious decision of retribution for an unpunished crime". [tpl]cite news|title=Baralong Case|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/15635604|accessdate=28 July 2013|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=6 January 1916|page=7[/tpl] Sir Edward Grey replied through the American ambassador that the incident could be grouped together with the Germans' sinking of SS Arabic, their attack on a stranded British submarine on the neutral Dutch coast, and their attack on the steamship Ruel, and suggested that they be placed before a tribunal composed of US Navy officers.Hesperides (2007) pp. 58-59

===German reaction===

A debate took place in the Reichstag on 15 January 1916, where the incident was described as a "cowardly murder" and Grey's note as being "full of insolence and arrogance".[tpl]citequote[/tpl] It was announced that reprisals had been decided, but not what form they would take.
The outrage aroused in Germany by Baralong[tpl]'[/tpl]s actions was used by the Kaiserliche Marine to justify attacking and sinking ships without warning at sea during the First World War, and was used again in the Second World War as a reason for the Kriegsmarine to do the same. A German medal was issued commemorating the event.[tpl]cite web|url=http://collections.nmm.ac.uk/collections/objects/39815.html |title=Medal commemorating the sinking of 'U.27' by Q-ship 'Baralong', 1915 |work=The Collection |publisher=National Maritime Museum |accessdate=10 December 2011[/tpl] Baralong and her crew were also placed on the Kaiserliche Marine[tpl]'[/tpl]s "Black List": any member of her crew was to be shot on sight if captured.
As a precaution to protect the ships against any reprisals against their crews, HMS Wyandra[tpl]clarify|Renamed when|date=December 2011[/tpl] was transferred to the Mediterranean, and took the name of sister ship Manica, while Baralong[tpl]'[/tpl]s name was deleted from Lloyd's Register. Nicosian was renamed Nevisian, and the crew was issued new Discharge Books, with the voyage omitted.O'Neill (2006) p. 10
Baralong[tpl]'[/tpl]s crew were later awarded £185 prize bounty for sinking U-27.Chatterton (1980) p. 26
A Kriegsmarine submarine flotilla formed on 25 June 1938 was named "Wegener" in memory of U-27[tpl]'[/tpl]s commander.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]

==Second incident==

===Action of 24 September 1915===

On 24 September 1915, Baralong sank the U-boat [tpl]SMS|U-41|Germany|2|sub=y[/tpl], for which her commanding officer at the time, Lieutenant-Commander A. Wilmot-Smith, was later awarded £170 prize bounty.
U-41 was in the process of sinking SS Urbino with gunfire when Baralong arrived on the scene, flying an American flag. When U-41 surfaced near Baralong, the latter opened fire while continuing to fly the American flag, and sank the U-boat.

===Aftermath of the second incident===

Unlike the neutral Americans in the first incident, the only witnesses to the second attack were the German and British sailors present. Oberleutnant zur See Iwan Crompton, after returning to Germany from a prisoner-of-war camp, reported that Baralong had run down the lifeboat he was in; he leapt clear and was shortly after taken aboard Baralong. The British crew denied that they had run down the lifeboat.Messimer, pp. 61-62
Crompton later published an account of U-41[tpl]'[/tpl]s exploits in 1917, U-41: der zweite Baralong-Fall, which called the sinking of U-41 a "second Baralong case".Hadley (1995) p. 36
The event was also commemorated in a propaganda medal designed by the German engraver Karl Goetz. This was one of many medals that were popular in Germany from around 1910 to 1940.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]

Robert "Bob" Young is a serial entrepreneur whose biggest success has been Red Hat Inc, the open source software company. He is also the owner of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League. He was born in Ancaster, Ontario, Canada.[tpl]cite web| title = Biography: Bob Young| url=http://www.feduja.org/evites/2006_Tech_BobYoung/young.htm| accessdate = 2007-01-21[/tpl] He attended Trinity College School in Port Hope, Ontario. He received a Bachelor of Arts from Victoria College at the University of Toronto. 
Prior to Red Hat, Young built a couple of computer rental and leasing businesses, including founding Vernon Computer Rentals in 1984.[tpl]cite web|title = Ticats Biography: Bob Young| url=http://www.ticats.ca/page/bob-young| accessdate = 2012-01-05[/tpl]  Descendants of Vernon are still operating under that name.  After leaving Vernon, Young founded the ACC Corp Inc. in 1993.  
Marc Ewing and Young's partnership started in 1994 when ACC acquired the Red Hat trademarks from Ewing. In early 1995, ACC changed its name to Red Hat Software, which has subsequently changed to simply Red Hat, Inc. Young served as Red Hat's CEO until 1999. 
After leaving Red Hat he founded Lulu.com in 2002, a self-publishing web-site that claims to be the world's fastest-growing provider of print-on-demand books. He is Lulu's CEO. In 2006 Young established the Lulu Blooker Prize, a book prize for books that began as blogs. He launched the prize partly as a means of promoting Lulu.
Young also co-founded Linux Journal in 1994, and in 2003, he purchased the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, a Canadian Football League franchise. 
Young is a strong believer in user-generated content and open source software. In a 2008 interview he described the way that online social media has empowered consumers:
 
 Today the Internet connects every single one of your customers, not just to you but to each other. So you produce a lemon of a car and you won’t know where to hide because your customers are going to tell each other about it and then the rest of the world about it. So it is actually a fundamentally healthy thing from a consumer point of view.
Conversely if you do have a better product suddenly you have these businesses that grow like topsy. If you come up with an innovation that serves, that resonates with customers, the Internet will allow that innovation to spread dramatically faster than any other technology has enabled a new innovation to be adopted in the history of mankind.“Expert Business Advice: Bob Young on why the people are more powerful than ever” (video) Retrieved 2009-10-06

Young focuses his philanthropic efforts to support an increased access to information and advancement of knowledge.  In 1999 he founded The Center for the Public Domain.  Young currently supports Creative Commons, the Public Knowledge Project, the Dictionary of Old English, the Internet Archive, ibiblio, the NCSU eGames,"NCSU eGames official site" accessed 2012-01-05 and the Bald Head Island Conservancy,"BHIC official site" accessed 2012-01-05 among others.

==Family==

Joyce Young, Bob Young's aunt, purchased stock in Red Hat Inc. shortly after its founding. When Red Hat's stock rose significantly after its initial public offering in 1999, they sold enough stock to recoup their initial investment, and retained some stocks. By January 2000, the remaining stock was valued in the millions. In June 2000, she donated $40 million to the Hamilton Community Foundation to be used largely in improvement of Hamilton-area health facilities, an act that represented one of the single largest charitable donations in Canadian history. The couple also made significant donations to the Royal Military College of Canada.
